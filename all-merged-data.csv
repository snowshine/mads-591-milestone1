Increased avb6 receptors on IPF lung tissue has been well documented, while its expression remains relatively non-existent in the healthy adult lung. The PET tracer's application will be expanded in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and COVID-19 pneumonia. The integrin avb6 is also up-regulated in the biliary epithelial cells, which drive the progression of biliary tree strictures and liver fibrosis through activation of TGF-b, as shown in IPF. Similarly, COVID-19 pneumonia is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 and leads to acute lung injury and integrin avb6 up-regulation. The selected PET tracer [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 has shown promise in identifying integrin avb6 in both preclinical and clinical studies at Stanford University. The investigators have demonstrated low [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 radiopharmaceutical uptake in the heart and lung region of healthy volunteers, which was an expected biodistribution (the normal tissue uptake of the radiopharmaceutical within the body) based on immunohistochemical staining of healthy lung tissue, which demonstrated the presence of minimal avb6 receptors in healthy lung tissue. OBJECTIVE: 1. Exploring the use of the investigational radiopharmaceutical [18]FFP-R01-MG-F2 as a biomarker for avb6 integrin in fibrotic lung tissue. 2. Exploring the use of the investigational radiopharmaceutical [18]FFP-R01-MG-F2 to access inflammation and fibrosis in the bile duct and liver. 3. Exploring the use of the investigational radiopharmaceutical [18]FFP-R01-MG-F2 to assess lung injury in COVID-19 pneumonia. The performance of [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT will be assessed in a cohort of up to 13-15 IPF patients, 5 PSC patients, 5 COVID19 pneumonia patients, and 5 age-matched healthy controls. Feasibility will be measured by drawing regions of interest (ROI) around the lung/ liver of participants with IPF, COVID19, or PSC, respectively, and the lungs of healthy adult volunteers and comparing the calculated standardized uptake value maximum(s) (SUV max). The tracer's biodistribution, safety, and tolerability will also be studied. Recruitment of IPF subjects and healthy volunteers has been completed, although recruitment for other aspects of this clinical trial is ongoing.",Covid19 Pneumonia|Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis|Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,,Drug: [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2,Drug:[18F]FP-R01-MG-F2:7mCi (range 6-9mCi) [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 will be administered,"Experimental:[18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 PET/CT in actively infected COVID19 Patients:Arm 3: 7mCi (range 6-9 mCi) [18F]FP-R01-MG-F2 will be administered to the study participant.

It is under development for the treatment of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) resulting from infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2), where there is significant unmet medical need.","Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine, is a key driver of a cytokine storm that plays a significant role in clinical complications and acute lung injury. Emerging data indicate that serum levels of IL-6 are elevated in COVID-19 patients and are predictive of respiratory failure and mortality. IL-6 has been shown to contribute to lung damage during SARS-CoV infection and the virus itself is capable of directly inducing its expression. Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. In a mouse model of lung injury employing bleomycin, BLD-2660, at therapeutic doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg twice per day (BID), reduced IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. BLD-2660 also attenuated fibrosis damage as measured by significant reductions in the alpha smooth muscle actin and collagen 1 in lung tissue. BLD-2660 also demonstrated target engagement by inhibiting cleavage of one of its substrates, spectrin, in bronchoalveolar cells. BLD-2660 was also evaluated in a mouse model of NASH fibrosis, demonstrating an anti-fibrotic effect. A significant decrease in IL-6 transcription was also observed. This suggests that the effect of BLD-2660 on IL-6 is independent of the injury, or the affected organ. It has been shown that the receptor for SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry into the cell is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). ACE-2 and the dimeric calpains (data on file) are co-expressed in respiratory epithelial cells, the site of both viral entry and predominant early lung injury in COVID-19. Inhibition of dimeric calpain activity has not been associated with impairment of normal immune function. The safety and tolerability of BLD-2660 has been demonstrated in the recently completed Phase 1 single ascending dose (SAD)/multiple ascending dose (MAD) B-2660-101 study. As BLD-2660 has been demonstrated to (1) reduce tissue IL-6 levels and (2) attenuate lung fibrosis damage, it could therefore, potentially reduce the nonproductive IL-6 mediated host-response to infection, which contribute to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. In addition, data suggest that survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection are at risk for chronic impairment of pulmonary function, likely attributable to pulmonary fibrosis secondary to lung injury and inflammation. Although there is not yet available data documenting numbers of patients infected with SARS CoV2 pneumonia who progress to pulmonary fibrosis, epidemiology, viral immunology, and current clinical evidence support that pulmonary fibrosis may become one of the serious long-term complications of survivors of COVID-19 related pneumonia. Thus, BLD-2660 could not only potentially downregulate the nonproductive host-response to infection, which contributes to morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 but also could reduce potential long-term fibrosis and loss of pulmonary function resulting from SARS-CoV pneumonia.

Hospitalized for COVID-19. Diagnosed with COVID-19 as defined by having at least 2 of the following signs or symptoms within the past 2 days: - Fever defined as a body temperature of ≥ 38.0 °C oral, or ≥ 38.3 °C rectal, ≥37.7 °C forehead or ≥38.7°C aural (axillary temperatures are not allowable); - Cough; - Fatigue; - Shortness of breath. Radiographic evidence (chest x-ray or CT scan) of one the following: - Ground-glass opacities, or - Local or bilateral patchy infiltrates, or - Interstitial pulmonary infiltrates. Oxygen requirements: - SpO2 ≤ 94% on ambient air OR - Requires supplemental oxygen administration by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or other similar oxygen delivery device. Male and/or female subjects. - Contraception use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies. All subjects (male or female) who are of childbearing potential must agree to use highly effective contraception during the study. Female subjects and male partners of female subjects must continue to use highly effective contraception for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Female subjects should not donate oocytes during this time. Male subjects and female partners of male subjects must continue to use highly effective contraception for 90 days. Male subjects must agree not to donate sperm during this time. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. Note: Ethinyl estradiol is the primary estrogen used in hormonal contraceptives. The progestin component consists of norethindrone, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethindrone acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, norgestimate, desogestrel, and drospirenone. As BLD-2660 is a weak CYP3A4 inducer, exposure to both the estrogen and progestin components in hormonal contraceptives may be decreased, resulting in an increased risk of pregnancy. As such, it is recommended that subjects who are on hormonal contraceptives for birth control should use an alternate means of contraception (condoms, diaphragms, intrauterine device (IUD), other barrier methods, sexual abstinence, etc.) during participation in the study. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening within 72 hours prior to first administration of study drug. Women not of childbearing potential must be postmenopausal (defined as cessation of regular menstrual periods for at least 1 year Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the ICF and in this protocol Exclusion Criteria: Active bacterial pneumonia infection Known active tuberculosis (TB). History of Child-Pugh B or C cirrhosis. History of ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. Subjects requiring supplemental oxygen ≥0.75 FiO2. It is not in the best interest of the subjects to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive within the projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. The following laboratory parameters are excluded: - Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >5 x upper limit of normal (ULN); - Creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min. Requiring, or expected to require mechanical ventilation at screening. Treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine at study entry. Treatment with anti-IL 6, anti-IL-6 receptor antagonists, or with Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) in the past 30 days or plans to receive during the study period. Participation in any other clinical study of an experimental drug treatment for COVID-19 within 6 half-lives of the experimental treatment.

The study is evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo, given once daily for 30 days in addition to background local standard of care therapy, on reducing complications and all-cause mortality, or improving clinical recovery.","COVID-19 can lead to multiorgan failure, especially in high-risk patients. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, favorably impacts many processes dysregulated during acute illness such as COVID-19, has significant cardio- and reno-protective benefits in cardiometabolic disease, and may provide similar organ protection in COVID-19. The study population will include hospitalized patients with respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 of any duration, but without the need for mechanical ventilation. The eligible patients should have risk factors for developing serious complications of COVID-19, including hypertension, T2DM, ASCVD, HF and/or CKD stage 3 to 4. Patients will be treated for 30 days, with either dapagliflozin 10 mg daily or placebo, each to be given in addition to the usual standard of care in the participating hospital. The study assessments include only those that are absolutely critical for ensuring the safety of the patients, to measure efficacy outcomes, and collect biomarker data, so as not to place too high a burden on the study personnel and to minimize additional risk of exposure to SARS CoV-2. The dual primary efficacy endpoints of the study are time to first event of either complications or death from any cause, and improved clinical recovery through 30 days of follow-up.

The WHO named the disease - coronavirus disease (COVID-19). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that COVID-19 should be characterized as a pandemic. At great economic cost, many countries have adopted unprecedented measures to curb the spread of the virus, such as large-scale use of isolation and quarantine, closing borders, imposing limits on public gatherings, and implementing nationwide lockdowns. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may exhibit nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. About 40% of the symptomatic patients recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people infected with SARS-CoV-2 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high chronic cardiovascular and respiratory disease or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. Monitoring patients with resolution of COVID-19 pneumonia is important in terms of when they should be released from isolation and discharged and to what extent this result is correlating with the clinical severity. If patients are still shedding viable coronavirus, they are likely to infect others. Therefore, quarantine for up to one month may be advisable. The optimal method for test of cure most likely will be two consecutive negative real-time RT-PCR tests. Furthermore, people who have cleared SARS-CoV-2 could have developed specific antibodies against the infectious agent in their blood plasma as a result of humoral immune response. This plasma is rich with specific antibodies and is called convalescent plasma (CP) or convalescent serum (CS). CP could treat and eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in infected individuals and could be used as therapy. This therapy concept was centuries old and was previously attempted during several outbreaks. Currently, there are few reports from China and South Korea showing that patients who received CP transfusion together with antiviral drugs and corticosteroids have recovered from the disease. It is the aim of the COVeR study to enroll 400 patients with COVID-19 from nursing homes of the german state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Each patient will enter a follow-up phase of 6 months during which buccal swaps will be collected for judging the viral load, and blood samples for investigation of their immune response and identifying predictive biomarkers.",Cough|Pneumonia|Fever,COVID-19,,,N/A:Participants with SARS-COV-2:Participants tested positive for SARS-COV-2 aged 60 years or older,,"Identification of prognostic parameters for SARS-CoV-2 infected participants.|Investigation of the kinetics of immune activation and antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 and correlation with clinical course|Identification of predictive biomarker/s for clinical course in mildly and severely affected Covid-19 patients using genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic approach.",2020-12-20,2021-10-30,2021-11-30,2020-04-22,,2020-11-24,"ClinicalTrials.gov processed this data on January 29, 2021",2020-04-20,No,No,No,No,,0,No,No,Observational Model: Cohort|Time Perspective: Prospective,,1.0,,,Cohort,,,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,60 Years,,All,,,No,Participants with SARS-C0V-2,Inclusion Criteria: - Informed consent is obtained from the participant/legal guardian - Participant has been identified to be positive for SARS-C0V-2 - The participant is 60 years old or older Exclusion Criteria: - The informed consent is not obtained from the participant/legal guardian - Participant has not been identified to be positive for SARS-C0V-2 - The participant is younger than 60 years of age,No,,Centogene ,CNTG

No proven therapies have been identified to prevent progression of the virus. Preliminary data suggest that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) could have benefit in preventing viral progression and reducing reliance on supplemental oxygen and ventilator support. Expanded access allows for iNO to be delivered via the portable INOpulse delivery system for the treatment of COVID-19.,"NO is a naturally produced molecule that is critical to the immune response to defend against pathogens and infections. In vitro studies have shown that NO inhibits the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and improves survival for cells infected with SARS-CoV. Additionally, in a clinical study of patients infected with SARS-CoV, iNO demonstrated improvements in arterial oxygenation, a reduction in ventilation support and an improvement in lung infiltrates observed on chest radiography. Based on the genetic similarities between the two coronaviruses, the data in SARS-CoV support the potential for iNO to provide meaningful benefit for patients infected with COVID-19. The clinical spectrum of the COVID-19 infection ranges from mild signs of upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia and death. Preventing disease progression in patients with mild or moderate disease would improve morbidity/mortality and significantly reduce the impact on limited healthcare resources. Expanded access allows for iNO to be delivered via the INOpulse delivery system for the treatment of COVID-19.

The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1: to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s); Phase 2/3: an expanded cohort and efficacy part. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 3 different SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 and the efficacy of 1 candidate: - As a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule; - At various different dose levels in Phase 1; - As a booster; - In 3 age groups (Phase 1: 18 to 55 years of age, 65 to 85 years of age; Phase 2/3: ≥12 years of age [stratified as 12-15, 16-55 or >55 years of age]). The candidate selected for efficacy evaluation in Phase 2/3 is BNT162b2 (mid-dose). Participants ≥16 years of age who originally received placebo will be offered the opportunity to receive BNT162b2 at defined points as part of the study. In order to describe the boostability of BNT162, and potential heterologous protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, an additional dose of BNT162b2 will be given to Phase 1 participants approximately 6 to 12 months after their second dose of BNT162b1 or BNT162b2. This will provide an early assessment of the safety of a third dose of BNT162, as well as its immunogenicity. The assessment of boostability will be further expanded in a subset of Phase 3 participants who will receive a third dose of BNT162b2 or a third and potentially a fourth dose of prototype BNT162b2VOC (BNT162b2s01, based upon the South African variant and hereafter referred to as BNT162b2SA). To further describe potential homologous and heterologous protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, a new cohort of participants will be enrolled who are COVID-19 vaccine-naïve (ie, BNT162b2-naïve) and have not experienced COVID-19.

In this study we plan to investigate if an experimental drug called IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium) can improve your symptoms, prevent worsening that would initiate further treatments such as ventilation, and can lower your virus number if given in addition to your doctor's choice of standard therapy. We will also test if IMU-838 has any side effects and measure the level of IMU 838 in your blood. Experimental drug means that it is not yet authorized for marketing in your country. To date approximately 600 individuals have received IMU-838 (or a drug similar to IMU-838 that contains the same active substance as IMU-838) in research studies.","The trial consists of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept phase (Part 1) with the option to extend enrollment (without interruption) to Phase 3 (Expansion Phase, Part 2). This trial is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IMU-838 as addition to investigator's choice of SoC treatment in patients with COVID-19. Eligible patients will be centrally randomized 1:1 to twice-daily (BID) oral 22.5 mg IMU-838 (45 mg/day + SoC) or placebo (+ SoC). Randomization will be stratified by age (< or >=65 years) and antiviral therapy (no antivirals, Hydroxychloroquine and Chloroquine, all other antivirals). Adaptive sequential trial design and overall trial design The trial uses an adaptive sequential design. An IDMC will review unblinded data and provide the Sponsor with recommendations regarding modifications of sample size and trial conduct. A 1st interim analysis (IA1) will be performed after approximately 200 patients have completed the trial (either as scheduled or prematurely), while enrollment continues. If no activity of IMU 838 is observed by the IDMC in this IA, further patient enrollment will be stopped, and a final analysis of Part 1 will be performed (FA1). It is expected that the final analysis of Part 1 will include approximately 230 patients. If the IA1 results indicate activity of IMU-838 in COVID-19, the trial may be extended to Part 2 with a revised sample size derived by the IDMC based on IA1 results and with possible other trial adjustments. If the trial is extended into Part 2, a 2nd IA (IA2) is planned after approximately two-thirds of patients (based on the overall global sample size [Part 1 and Part 2 combined]) have been enrolled to potentially adjust sample size and other trial features if needed. The final analysis of the trial (FA2) will then be done after all patients have completed Part 2. In addition, an early interim safety analysis will be performed and evaluated by the IDMC after 30 patients have been enrolled to assess unblinded safety data. Further safety analyses can be initiated at any time by the IDMC or Sponsor when new safety signals are identified within this or other trials of IMU-838. Screening Patients can be screened for a maximum of 2 days (from Day -2 to Day 0) and eligible patients will be randomized on Day 0 and treated with IMP + SoC for 14 days. It is encouraged to screen potential participants immediately at the day of hospitalization (including informed consent, assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria, screening laboratory tests all done locally, assessment of clinical and blood gas criteria) and randomize patients on the same day (Day 0). To assess eligibility criteria, existing local laboratory values obtained within 48 hours of randomization can also be used, except for testing of positive status of SARS-CoV-2 infection where a 4-day window is allowed. IMP administration should start as quickly as possible after randomization and first IMP intended to be given in the evening of the screening day (Day 0). Blinded Treatment period (Day 0 to Day 13) and Day 14 (end-of-treatment) The first dose of IMP (2 tablets) should always be given on Day 0 (allowed range for first dose: 12:00 noon on Day 0 to 02:00 a.m.). All further IMP doses are 1 tablet each in the morning and evening. Information about the status and patient care are continuously obtained and documented once or twice daily. After the last IMP dose in the evening of Day 13, the end-of-treatment assessments will be done on Day 14. Blood sampling for IMU-838 trough values must be performed in the morning around the time the morning dose was usually taken by the respective patient. Patients may then continue to receive SoC without any further restrictions on concomitant medications as during the 14-day BT period . Day 28 Visit (EoS) The patient should return for the final trial visit on Day 28 (EoS). If IMP is prematurely discontinued for any reason, the EoS visit should always be conducted on Day 28 and no earlier EoS should be performed. If patients withdraw from IMP prematurely, they should be encouraged to allow the EoS visit as part of the follow-up. If the patient dies during the trial, the investigator should indicate that this visit was not performed. However, even if no EoS visit was performed, information about patient status should be reported on the EoS page in the case report form. If the patient refuses any EoS visit or the patient is lost to follow-up, it is permissive in this trial that the investigator contacts the patient, the family of the patient or the referring physician by phone or email to obtain status of life information, or is able to search in registers or publicly available information for such status of life information.",COVID-19,,Drug: IMU-838|Other: Placebo,"Drug:IMU-838:Tablets will be taken BID with a glass of water (if possible); one tablet each in the morning (15 to 50 min before a meal if applicable), and in the evening (2 hours after any meal if applicable).

Interferon alpha is a protein important for defense against viruses. It activates immune responses that help to clear viral infection. Rintatolimod is double stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) designed to mimic viral infection by stimulating immune pathways that are normally activated during viral infection. Giving rintatolimod and interferon alpha-2b may activate the immune system to limit the replication and spread of the virus.,"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I.

Symptoms of COVID-19 infection may appear from 2 to 14 days following exposure, with the spectrum of illnesses ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness or death. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 follows the emergence of 2 other novel betacoronaviruses: SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Current management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. While an understanding of the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is still evolving during the ongoing pandemic, the current knowledge of the disease burden highlights the urgent medical need to develop a treatment. Sirukumab (also known as CNTO136) is a human anti-interleukin (IL)-6 immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Sirukumab binds with high affinity and specificity to human IL-6 and as a result inhibits IL-6-mediated signaling and the biological effects of IL-6. The study will include a Screening Phase (up to 1 Day), a Treatment Phase (Day 1 to Day 28) and a Follow-up Phase (post Day 28, follow-up phone calls on Week 8, Week 12 and Week 16).

The gammaCore® (nVNS) treatments will be used acutely and prophylactically. The aims of this study are to summarize and compare the incidence of clinical events and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in patients randomized to use of gammaCore Sapphire plus standard of care vs standard of care alone in patients hospitalized for CoViD-19. Secondary objectives are demonstrate the safety of gammaCore Sapphire use in patients hospitalized for CoViD-19.","Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has an established history of reducing airway distress. VNS has at least two mechanisms of action that may profoundly affect respiratory function in patients with respiratory distress due to CoViD-19. First, vagus nerve stimulation modulates bronchoconstriction, acute stimulation has demonstrated a marked improvement in Work of Breathing (WOB) as well as Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) in patients with severe respiratory distress due to airway reactivity. This effect appears to occur via an afferent response to stimulation of the vagus nerve. Second, and perhaps more importantly, VNS has been shown to be a potent moderator of pathologic immune reactions, specifically suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels via activation of the Cholinergic Anti-inflammatory Pathway (CAP). VNS is currently being studied to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines patterns and concentrations in a variety of acute and progressive inflammatory conditions, ranging from septic shock and asthma to stroke, rheumatoid arthritis and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. VNS has been studied in animal models of acute septic shock, consistently demonstrating life-saving potential. In one such study, cecal ligation and puncture was used to induce a septic state in an animal model. VNS reduced the expression of cytokines which was tightly associated with survival. Specifically, in animal and human models, this neuromodulatory therapy has the capacity to reduce the expression of inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. These are precisely the same cytokines which are elevated in ARDS and other inflammatory disorders. In all cases, the therapy has shown considerable promise as a potential alternative to steroids (having potent anti-inflammatory activity but without the adverse side effects of steroids) and biologic therapies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines (broadly - e.g., tofacitinib, or specifically - e.g., adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab). Viral-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including those caused by SARS CoV-1 and MERS are characterized by a massive systemic pro-inflammatory state. Although a pro-inflammatory environment is required to control the rate of infection as well as the eradication of infected and compromised cells, the massive response to these viruses, primarily due to leukocytes of the innate arm of the immune system, is part of the problem as a significant number of tissues are damaged and lost secondary to the infected tissues in a by-stander and collateral manner. A simple, drug-free approach to attenuate this systemic inflammation would be of significant benefit to the progression of the syndrome and potentially improve the overall recovery of the patients. For these reasons, the investigators propose that VNS may ameliorate the over-activity of the pro-inflammatory immune condition in CoViD-19 patients, thus conferring a superior therapeutic option especially for elderly patients and those presenting with respiratory illness in setting of co-morbid conditions who experience severe symptoms. These groups are at particularly high risk of requiring mechanical ventilation, developing ARDS, experiencing severe cytokine storm and have a higher mortality rate. Non-Invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation (nVNS) - Historically, VNS was delivered using implanted signal generators coupled to leads having electrodes that wrap around the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is located within the carotid sheath, and thus the implantation surgery is complicated with inherent risks, particularly in the critically ill. More recently, a non-invasive approach to vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) was cleared by the FDA for the acute treatment of pain associated episodic cluster and migraine headaches and the prevention of cluster headaches and migraine headaches. This device, gammaCore (electroCore, Inc., Basking Ridge, NJ) is handheld and requires no surgery or implants. The device is applied by healthcare providers or patients to the skin at the neck over the vagus nerve to deliver periodic doses of VNS non-invasively. With respect to bronchoconstriction, early studies demonstrated modulation of airway reactivity in hospitalized asthmatic patients, improving various measures of airway patency. Non-invasive VNS (nVNS) is a safe method of stimulating the vagus nerve, with minimal side effects. It does not require surgery or an invasive procedure that would otherwise limit its utility in the critically ill. The stimulation can be either self-administered or administered by a health care practitioner. There are numerous studies with both implanted and nVNS in multiple animal models and humans that have demonstrated a modulation of the inflammatory cascade with an improvement in survival. gammaCore® (nVNS) has been studied in approximately 2,000 patients as part of clinical trials with an excellent safety profile. It is available through commercial insurers and the private pay market, and is listed on the federal supply schedule available for purchase by the VA and Department of Defense and also carries a CE mark for distribution abroad. More than ten thousand patients have been successfully treated in the United States and abroad. CoViD-19 Respiratory Issues Involve Virally-triggered Severe (Lethal) Cytokine Expression - CoViD-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is caused by SARS CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and is related to the coronavirus which caused SARS in 2003 (SARS CoV-1). The virus is transmitted either through airborne droplets (e.g. coughing or sneezing) or direct contact (e.g. through a surface containing the virus), with a mean incubation period between 4 and 7 days (range 2 days to > 2 weeks). As of April 3, 2020, there are over a million confirmed cases and rising with 55,000 individuals deceased to date. This gives a current mortality rate of 5.3 %, although the base case of confirmed cases may be markedly underestimated. Elderly and those with co-morbid conditions including heart disease, diabetes, and asthma seem to have a higher mortality rate. Many CoViD-19 patients experience moderate to severe respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath and impaired oxygen saturation. Eighty-eight percent (88%) of patients present with respiratory symptoms. A significant and increasing number of CoViD-19 patients require hospitalization, and progress to being intubated and/or ventilator dependent. Given the rapid spread of this contagion, concern exists that the international healthcare systems do not have the number of ventilators and/or ICU beds to meet the expected demand in the coming months. The most critically afflicted can experience pneumonia and/or ARDS. Accumulating evidence suggests that this subgroup with severe CoViD-19 likely have a cytokine storm syndrome, a hallmark of ARDS that includes dramatic increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β among others. Elevations in IL-6 seem to be a particularly poor outcome indicator of respiratory compromise. It is believed that the mortality of ARDS is at least partially the result of an over activity of the patient's immune system.30 Predictors of fatality from a recent retrospective, multi-center study of 150 confirmed CoViD-19 cases in Wuhan, China, included elevated ferritin (mean 1297•6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614•0 ng/ml in survivors; p<0•001) and IL-6 (p<0•0001)31, suggesting that mortality and respiratory decompensation may be due to virally-driven hyperinflammation. Therapies that could block the cytokine storm may help improve survival and decrease the need for ventilator use and prolonged respiratory support. Other companies are in fact developing pharmaceutical approaches for the treatment of cytokine storm, or plasma infusions from those who have recovered from the virus. At this point there is no cure or vaccine for the virus and neither is there a treatment approach to dampen the systemic inflammation. Given the CE mark and excellent safety profile, including the twenty year history of the use of VNS to block the over production of pro-inflammatory mediators via the CAP (cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway), and the lack of other effective or reasonable options during this pandemic the investigators propose deploying gammaCore® (nVNS) devices for prophylactic use to those who have been diagnosed as infected with the virus, but before the cytokine storm begins to cause and/or exacerbate the severe respiratory distress syndrome. The hypothesis is that the administration of non-invasive VNS using gammaCore®, during and following severe infection with CoViD-19 may prevent the worsening inflammatory response and acute injury associated, thus decreasing ventilator dependence and mortality of the virus. If utilized early enough in the course of disease the investigators hope to reduce ventilator dependence and improve survival with a scientifically driven safe and cost-effective approach. Furthermore, through additional acute utility of gammaCore® (nVNS) in cases of ARDS and cytokine storm the investigators can effectively blunt the pro inflammatory response, reduce mortality and liberate patients from mechanical ventilation earlier which will assist in deploying the ventilator to other patients in need during the CoViD-19 pandemic. electroCore has designed a non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (nVNS) device called gammaCore®. The gammaCore® (nVNS) device is a handheld, battery-powered unit that produces a proprietary electrical waveform in the vicinity of the vagus nerve in the neck. Each treatment, or dose, is relatively brief (120 seconds) and the user maintains control over the stimulation intensity. gammaCore® is currently commercially available for the treatment of cluster and migraine headaches, and broad safety data with thousands of patients treated in the US Europe and the UK in both clinical trials and routine clinical care. Treatment paradigms have been developed and tested in clinical trials to support FDA clearance for the acute treatment of pain associated with episodic cluster and migraine headaches, and the prevention of cluster and migraine headache. This experience demonstrates that nVNS may be administered safely in up to 24 two-minute doses per day. The investigators thus have data to draw on as to how to effectively stimulate the vagus nerve. Given the multiple modes of action with blocking the CAP, and acute bronchodilatation, using a similar treatment paradigm for a trial to evaluate nVNS treatment of ARDS is reasonable. The device should be used both prophylactically and acutely early in the course of the disease prior to mechanical ventilation, and once trained, treatment can be fully managed by either a healthcare professional or the patient. If one waits until mechanical ventilation has started, it is less likely that a therapy will be able to block the cytokine storm and outcomes will be less profound. With respect to the theoretical cardiac and respiratory side effects of non-invasive treatment, historically, stimulation of the vagus nerve is associated with adverse side effects, including bradycardia and bronchoconstriction. These effects were shown to be the result of in discriminant stimulation of all fibers in the vagal bundle (the vagus nerve is primarily comprised of A and C fibers), which could be avoided by specifically tuning the electrical signals to selectively stimulate only the A fibers. This is possible because of the difference in electric field strengths necessary to activate the different fiber types. The intensity, pulse duration and frequency of gammaCore® (nVNS) stimulation parameters have been optimized to induce signals in the large, myelinated Aβ fibers of the cervical branch of the vagus nerve. Since gammaCore® activates only the low threshold afferent Aβ fibers, versus the high threshold efferent C-fibers that innervate the heart, there is no known risk for adverse cardiac or other systemic parasympathetic effects. electroCore has conducted pre-clinical studies to assess the potential risk of vagus nerve over-stimulation on the heart and airways. Several studies were conducted in beagle dogs with hypersensitized airways (worst case for airway reactivity) at maximum stimulation output for 2 minutes. Review of heart rate and airway resistance before, during and after stimulation indicated that there were no significant adverse changes associated with stimulation. These results are consistent with the human clinical experience with the gammaCore® device. Regarding the theorized mechanism of action, afferent fibers from the vagus nerve enter the brain and synapse onto the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the brain stem , making connections with many structures in the brain including the locus coeruleus (LC), the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the raphe nucleus (RN). These structures are known to control the release of key inhibitory neurotransmitters. Numerous animal and clinical studies over the last 25 years have implicated the activity of these structures, in particular the LC, in the mechanism of action of VNS to inhibit seizures. Clinical Use for Clinical Care - Given the lack of other effective and/or reasonable options for a patient with CoViD-19 respiratory distress and the anticipated demands on our healthcare system, considering gammaCore® (nVNS) therapy, the investigators propose, is a reasonable approach. To achieve goal of decreasing health care burden with patient benefit of decreasing ventilator dependency, inflammatory response and mortality, plan to use it early in course of disease i.e. prior to severe respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation. The presumptive mechanisms of bronchodilatation and modulation of the cytokine storm would suggest that early intervention is ideal in improving pulmonary function and avoiding respiratory depression. 1. Prevention. Mitigation of pro-inflammatory immunokine release would be best achieved with two doses, consisting of a two-minute stimulation, on each side of the neck three times a day (am, afternoon and an hour before bed). This would be a total of 6 treatments (2 stimulations x 3 times per day) of stimulation as a prophylactic/preventive measure. This dosage is well below the known safety dosage threshold 2. In addition, patients may receive additional treatments when experiencing acute respiratory distress. Similarly, one treatment is two doses. Each treatment (a two-minute stimulation on each side of the neck) is performed on the neck. If shortness of breath (SOB) persists 20 minutes after start of first treatment, administer a second treatment. Maximum number of treatments per day is 9. This is symptomatic control and can be used to improve FEV1, Work of Breathing or dyspnea.","SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)|ARDS, Human|Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult|Respiratory Failure|Corona Virus Infection|COVID",,Other: Standard of care therapies|Device: gammaCore® Sapphire (non-invasive vagus nerve stimulator),"Other:Standard of care therapies:Will receive standard of care therapies for the treatment of CoViD-19 infection and symptoms|Device:gammaCore® Sapphire (non-invasive vagus nerve stimulator):Administer gammaCore® Sapphire daily, prophylactically, for three treatments (morning, mid-day and night, one hour before bed), each treatment consisting of two 2-minute doses/stimulations, one on each side of the neck.

The 3 dose levels (DL) are: DL1: 1x10^7 cells (flat dose) DL2: 2x10^7 cells (flat dose) DL3: 4x10^7 cells (flat dose) Enrollment to the dose escalation phase will be staggered. The first patient enrolled on each of the 3 dose levels (DL1, DL2 and DL3) will have to complete the 14-day toxicity monitoring window prior to enrollment of the next patients. Prior to dose escalation, all patients at a particular dose level should have completed the minimum 14-day toxicity monitoring window before enrolling to a higher dose level. After the dose finding phase is complete and the MTD established, a randomized trial will be conducted. Patient will be randomized 1:1 using the permuted block method with a block size of 4 (2 in the treatment arm and 2 in the control arm) to receive treatment with SARS-CoVSTs or routine treatment per institutional standards. All enrolled patients will undergo the following evaluations: - Physical exam and history including height and weight - SARS-CoV-2 test - Blood tests - Chest X-ray or chest CT Scan if not already done in the past 48 hours. - A urine pregnancy test, when applicable Patients randomized to receive SARS-CoVSTs will be pre-medicated with Benadryl and Tylenol. The cells will be thawed and given through an intravenous line. Patients will be monitored for infusion side effects for up to 14 days or until infusion side effects have completely resolved, whichever is longer. Blood will be drawn before the infusion and then up to daily for 14 days or until the patient is discharged from the hospital.

This in turn stimulates a pro-inflammatory cascade (""cytokine storm"") as well as emergency myelopoiesis. This proinflammatory cascade is activated when viral-mediated cell damage occurs in the lungs, resulting in the release of damage-signaling alarmin molecules such as S100A8/A9 (Calprotectin), HMGB1, Resistin, and oxidized phospholipids. These damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are recognized by the pattern recognition receptor Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) found on macrophages, dendritic cells and other innate immune cells and result in additional release of pro-inflammatory molecules. Several recent studies have shown that S100A8/A9 serum levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients positively correlate with both neutrophil count and disease severity. Taken together the DAMP-TLR4 interaction forms a central axis in the innate immune system and is a key driver of the pathological inflammation observed in COVID-19. We hypothesis that targeting the initial step in the signalling pathways of these DAMPs in innate immunity offers the best hope for controlling the exaggerated host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. EB05 has demonstrated safety in two clinical studies (>120 patients) and was able to block LPS-induced (TLR4 agonist) IL-6 release in humans. Given, this extensive body of evidence we believe EB05 could ameliorate ARDS due to COVID-19, significantly reducing ventilation rates and mortality.",,ARDS|COVID-19,COVID-19|ARDS|TLR4,Biological: SOC plus 15mg/kg EB05 IV|Other: SOC plus Placebo IV,Biological:SOC plus 15mg/kg EB05 IV:Standard of care plus single IV infusion of 15mg/kg of EB05.|Other:SOC plus Placebo IV:Standard of care plus a single IV infusion of placebo.,"Experimental:Stage 1:Stage 1 (Phase II Study) For 80% power (β = 0.20), at a significance level of 5% (α =0.05) and a 1:1 randomization ratio, a total of 316 (EB05: 158, SOC: 158) evaluable patients will be required.

In this stage, COVID-19 is associated with a decrease in suppressor and regulatory T cell counts and an extensive release of proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers called a cytokine storm, which is thought to be the major driver of severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. C1 esterase inhibitor (C1INH) is a member of the serpin superfamily of serine-protease inhibitors and is a strong inhibitor of the complement System (CS) and the kinin-kallikrein (KK) System. Conestat alfa is a recombinant human C1INH, that shares an identical protein structure with plasma-derived C1INH. The rationale of the current trial is based upon the following assumptions: In the context of COVID-19, conestat alfa treatment may 1) dampen uncontrolled complement activation and collateral lung damage and 2) reduce capillary leakage and subsequent pulmonary edema by direct inhibition of KK system.

Ta1 is a biological response modifier which activates various cells of the immune system, and is therefore expected to have clinical benefits in disorders where immune responses are impaired or ineffective, including acute and chronic viral and bacterial infections, cancers, and vaccine non-responsiveness. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, in addition to their intrinsic kidney disease and frequent burden of comorbidities, also have increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases as they are treated several times each week at hemodialysis centers with several other patients and clinic staff in attendance. The majority of patients are over 60 years of age and many are receiving immunosuppressive medications. Accordingly, ESRD patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Ta1 has been shown to be safely administered to hemodialysis patients. It is our hypothesis that a course of Ta1 administered to individuals with ESRD will reduce the rate and severity of infection with COVID-19.","Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, in addition to their intrinsic kidney disease and frequent burden of comorbidities, also have increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases as they are treated several times each week at hemodialysis centers with several other patients and clinic staff in attendance. The majority of patients are over 60 years of age and many are receiving immunosuppressive medications. Accordingly, ESRD patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Thymalfasin (thymosin alpha 1, Ta1) is a naturally occurring peptide that has been evaluated for its immunomodulatory activities and related therapeutic potential in several conditions and diseases, including infectious disease and cancer. ZADAXIN, a synthetic form of Ta1, been has been used clinically in pilot studies for treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and other lung infections including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), as well as infections after bone marrow transplant]. Larger clinical trials have shown significant efficacy for treatment of severe sepsis and hepatitis B, along with certain cancers such as melanoma, hepatocellular, and lung cancer. Ta1 has also demonstrated improvement in response to vaccines in the elderly and in patients immunocompromised by renal disease. The beneficial clinical effects of Ta1 result from activation of toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 in dendritic and other immune system cells, resulting in augmentation of T helper (Th1) function, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and increased antibody responses to T-cell dependent antigens. Importantly, Ta1 also leads to an increase in IL-10 producing regulatory T cells, which create feedback inhibition of cytokine production, hence dampening immune response and preventing a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. It is our hypothesis that a course of Ta1 administered to individuals at high risk for COVID-19 infection (hemodialysis patients) will reduce the rate of COVID-19 infection and severity of infection with COVID-19, compared to untreated individuals in the same hemodialysis units with comparable risk.

The study will use de-identified data collected from February 1, 2020 to start of study. The data set will include: repurposed medication name, strength, and dose; age (age limit set at 89 years old); gender; provider type; zip code (excludes 17 three-digit zip code tabulation areas that have a population of 20,000 or fewer persons); conditions; mortality; and a list of concomitant prescriptions.","There is a deficit in literature assessing the risk associated with these repurposed medications in COVID-19 patients. The investigators propose to evaluate if the use of repurposed drugs including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine is associated with an increased risk of mortality in COVID-19 infected patients treated with such medications. PrescribeWellness, a Tabula Rasa HealthCare solution, a leading patient relationship management service provider in U.S., facilitates collaboration between more than 15,000 pharmacies and payers, providers, and patients for better health. PrescribeWellness empowers community pharmacies with innovative technological solutions that advance a pharmacist's ability to identify, manage, and drive patient care interventions. On average, 2,000 patients receive their services per each pharmacy. PrescribeWellness expands the medication risk mitigation program of Tabula Rasa HealthCare in community pharmacies and ambulatory patients. The investigators propose to perform a retrospective analysis of data from infected COVID-19 patients served by PrescribeWellness pharmacies for assessing mortality and risk/benefit associated with the use of repurposed COVID-19 drugs. An approach to reduce and predict adverse drug events is the use of predictive risk scores. Tabula Rasa HealthCare's proprietary MedWise Risk Score™ (MRS) is based on five aggregated medication risk mitigation factors: FAERS (FDA adverse events reporting system) risk score, anticholinergic burden, sedative burden, drug-induced long QT syndrome, and CYP450 drug interaction burden. The MRS™ is a predictive tool used by health care providers to determine which factors, including prescription drugs, can contribute the most to a patient's likelihood of an adverse drug event (ADE) occurring. In order to calculate the MRS™, patient data is first de-identified, and then comprised by various physiological, pharmacological and biochemical variables. Once a patient is analyzed, his/her MRS™ is defined as Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, or Very High Risk for the likelihood of ADE. The investigators propose to retrospectively calculate the MRSTM and assess the predictive value of MRS™ in patients tested positive for COVID-19 and who were treated with repurposed drugs. The investigators hypothesize that an increase rate of mortality is associated with high risk MRS in patients receiving repurposed drugs against COVID-19.",Risk Reduction|Drug Interaction|Drug Effect|COVID,Mortality Rate|Adverse Drug Event|COVID-19,,,N/A:Not Treated with Repurposed Drugs:This cohort will be for individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 and were not treated with repurposed drugs.

The clinical course of COVID-19 is variable, and some patients develop severe pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and shock. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a hyper-inflammatory and hyper-thrombotic state. We propose that this state is caused by viral injury of the vascular endothelium, leading to endothelial release of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and P-selectin, which in turn drive thrombosis and vascular inflammation. Crizanlizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets P-selectin. Crizanlizumab can decrease inflammation by binding to P-selectin, blocking leucocyte and platelet adherence to the vessel wall.

INO- 4800 contains the plasmid pGX9501, which encodes for the full length of the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the tolerability, safety, and immunogenicity of INO-4800 administered by ID injection followed by EP in healthy adults in the Part A and Part B. Enrollment into Part A, and Part B will proceed sequentially.","[Part A] Part A is open-label, dose-ranging study, enrolling total of 40 subjects. Part A is divided into two arm, low dose (Group 1) and high dose (Group 2). The subjects will be contacted by telephone to report adverse events or other reactions the day following the first vaccination. Once these first five subjects in Group 1 complete the Week 1 visit, all available clinical laboratory and adverse event data will be reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Further enrollment into Group 1 will be paused during this DSMB review. If DSMB determines there are no safety findings judged to be of clinical concern and no dose limiting toxicities nor any stopping events observed, enrollment will be opened for the remaining subjects in Group 1. Once Group 1 enrollment is completed [i.e., 20 total subjects enrolled], Group 2 will open to enrollment. Daily safety assessment of all enrolled subjects will be supported by the Study Medical Monitor on an ongoing basis while the first five subjects are being enrolled, if needed. The subjects will be contacted by telephone to report adverse events or other reactions the day following the first vaccination. Once the first five subjects Group 2 complete the Week 1 visit, all available clinical laboratory and adverse event data from these first five subjects, along with the safety data from subjects in Group 1, will be reviewed by the DSMB. However, enrollment may continue while this DSMB review is conducted, without any pause to enrollment of the remaining subjects in Group 2. Once all subjects in Part A Group 1 and Group 2 complete the Week 8 visit, all available clinical laboratory, adverse event, immunogenicity data from all subjects will be reviewed by the DSMB. The DSMB will additionally review serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESIs) date throughout the study. With DSMB's recommendation, the optimal dose for Part B will be selected by the Sponsor based on the following criteria which may be adjusted over the course of the study. Percentage immunogenic seroconversionRelative immunogenicity between INO-4800 Study Arms (Low dose vs. High dose)Safety profile of each INO-4800 Study Arms (Low dose vs. High dose). All subjects will be followed for 48 weeks following the 2nd vaccination. Week 52 will be the End of Study (EOS) visit.

To date, there is no available effective treatment to avoid or reduce infection (vaccines or viral inhibitors), to reduce or eliminate viral intracellular replication (antivirals) or to mitigate the inflammatory cascade or the subsequent cytokine storm (immunomodulatory drugs) associated with high COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates although a press release of a multicenter trial showed that low-dose dexamethasone in high-risk patients was associated with a reduction in mortality. A simple strategy that can be globally implemented becomes necessary to minimize COVID-19 pandemic consequences on healthcare until an efficacious vaccine is available. Icosapent ethyl (IPE) at high doses has proven to be effective to reduce cardiovascular events in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. In the context of COVID-19, IPE could also be useful at pre-hospital and hospital stages due to its potential anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. High-level exposure and infection risk among health-care providers, as well as the fundamental need for their active role under the current pandemic, make the search for tools to reduce or avoid infection, or its clinical manifestations, a priority. We have, therefore, designed a study with a simple, pragmatic, and universally applicable strategy with IPE at high doses intended to reduce infection and subsequent morbidity and mortality among subjects at high risk of infection due to SARS-CoV-2.",COVID19,AMR101|Ethyl-EPA|Eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester|Vascepa|Icosapent ethyl,Drug: Icosapent ethyl (IPE)|Drug: Placebo,"Drug:Icosapent ethyl (IPE):Participants in this arm will receive study medication IPE with the following dosage schedule: 8 g of IPE (4 capsules every 12 hours - morning and evening, with food) for the first three days followed by 4 g of IPE (2 capsules every 12 hours - morning and evening, with food) thereafter (days 4-60)|Drug:Placebo:Participants in this arm will receive placebo with the following dosage schedule: 8 g of placebo (4 capsules every 12 hours - morning and evening, with food) for the first three days followed by 4 g of placebo (2 capsules every 12 hours - morning and evening, with food) thereafter (days 4-60)",Active Comparator:Active treatment:Participants in this arm will receive study medication icosapent ethyl (IPE) with a specific dose scheme.|Placebo Comparator:Placebo:Participants in this arm will receive Placebo with the same dose scheme as the active comparator:,Active Comparator[Active treatment]:Drug[Icosapent ethyl (IPE)]|Placebo Comparator[Placebo]:Drug[Placebo],"Mean highest WHO descriptive score in active treatment versus placebo groups up to day 60 among hospitalized patients (WHO grades 3 or more) without serum evidence / PCR detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection|Rate of total events, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke or death (initial and subsequent), up to day 60|Percentage of SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects|Highest mean WHO descriptive score of COVID-19 in the active treatment group compared to the placebo group.|Highest mean WHO score up to day 60 for the active treatment group as compared to placebo among subjects with a positive test received at any moment during the study after the first visit|Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides (mg/dL) at baseline and at day 60|Ultrasensitive C-reactive Protein (mg/dL) at baseline and at day 60|Difference in hospital length of stay between groups|Difference in duration of mechanical ventilation in both groups|Rate of hospital admissions due to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in patients who were negative for SARS CoV-2 upon admission",2020-08-14,2021-01-31,2021-01-31,2020-07-07,,2020-11-23,"ClinicalTrials.gov processed this data on January 29, 2021",2020-07-02,No,Yes,No,No,"Instituto de Investigaciones Clínicas - Rosario, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina",1,No,Yes,"Allocation: Randomized|Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment|Primary Purpose: Treatment|Masked: Triple (Participant, Caregiver, Investigator)",2.0,,Treatment,Parallel Assignment,,Randomized,Triple,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,18 Years,,All,,,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,"Inclusion Criteria: 18 years of age or older and 1.

This treatment was thought to reduce inflammation and was found to be effective without side effects. However, it was an expensive treatment and was eventually replaced with less expensive treatment options like penicillin. The COVID-19 virus has emerged recently, causing high rates of pneumonia in people. The authors believe that giving a small dose of radiation to the lungs may reduce inflammation and neutralize the pneumonia caused by COVID-19. For this study, the x-ray given is called radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-ray beams from a large machine to target the lungs and reduce inflammation. Usually, it is given at much higher doses to treat cancers. The purpose of this study is to find out if adding a single treatment of low-dose x-rays to the lungs might reduce the amount of inflammation in the lungs from COVID-19 infection, which could reduce the need for a ventilator or breathing tube.","The authors propose a two-step randomized Phase II study to determine if single fraction low dose whole thorax megavoltage radiotherapy (LD-WTRT) can produce meaningful clinical benefit in COVID-19 patients. In Step 1, patients would be randomized 1:2 to standard of care without or with LD-WTRT. Patients randomized to LD-WTRT would be further randomized to either 35 cGy or 100 cGy. After 20 patients have been enrolled on each low-dose radiotherapy arm, they will be evaluated to determine the selection of the ""best radiotherapy dose-arm"" for the remainder of the patients. This will be done by analyzing clinical benefit, risk profile, and the dynamics of biomarker change, specifically focusing on IL-6 1. If the rate of Grade 4 toxicity is lower by an absolute rate of 15% when comparing the 35 cGy and 100 cGy arms, the arm with the lower toxicity rate will be used for Step 2 of the trial. 2. If the crude clinically meaningful event rate (CMER) which is a composite endpoint, is lower by an absolute rate of 20% when comparing the 35 cGy and 100 cGy arms, the lower CMER rate arm will be used for Step 2. CMER is defined as a composite of : 1. Rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) 2. Rate of prolonged hospital stay >10 days (PHS) 3. Crude all-cause mortality rate at the time of analysis 3. If the crude CMER is < 20% difference between the 35 cGy and 100 cGy arms, the investigators will determine whether there is a trend suggesting less Facility Resource Utilization Rate (FRUR). If the FRUR is 20% lower in either the 35 cGy or 100 cGy arms, that dose will be used for Step 2. The FRUR is based upon: 1. Days of mechanical ventilation 2. Days of hospitalization. 4. If both crude CMER and FRU rates do not differ by at least 20%, the investigators will evaluate the area under the curve (AUC) for IL-6 levels drawn within 24 hours before LD-WTRT and at 48 hours (2d) and 168 hours (7d) after radiation. If one of the two arms has a 20% lower serum IL-6 AUC one week after radiotherapy, the investigators will select that arm for Step 2. 5. If none of the parameters in numbers 1-4 above differ in the criteria listed, the investigators will use the lower dose of 35 cGy for Step 2.",Pneumonia|Sars-CoV2|Covid-19,Linac|radiotherapy|radiation,Radiation: High dose radiation 100 cGy|Radiation: Low dose radiation 35 cGy,Radiation:High dose radiation 100 cGy:A dose of 100 cGy of whole thorax irradiation will be delivered at a single timepoint|Radiation:Low dose radiation 35 cGy:A dose of 35 cGy of whole thorax irradiation will be delivered at a single timepoint,No Intervention:Control arm:Patients will receive no radiation therapy but will have research samples collected and best supportive care|Experimental:High radiation arm:A single dose of 100 cGY delivered to the whole thorax|Experimental:Low radiation arm:A single dose of 35 cGY delivered to the whole thorax,Experimental[High radiation arm]:Radiation[High dose radiation 100 cGy]|Experimental[Low radiation arm]:Radiation[Low dose radiation 35 cGy],Changes in blood ferritin levels between control and experimental arms|Changes in blood Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels between control and experimental arms|Changes in blood D-Dimer levels between control and experimental arms|Changes in blood IL-6 levels between control and experimental arms|Changes in blood C-reactive protein between control and experimental arms|Changes in neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio between control and experimental arms|Changes in neutrophil count between control and experimental arms|Changes in lymphocyte count between control and experimental arms|Changes of the cost of care for the control arm versus the radiation arms|Clinical benefit of Step 2 Radiation dose|Step 1 Dose selection,2020-08-28,2021-12-31,2022-12-31,2020-07-10,,2021-03-15,"ClinicalTrials.gov processed this data on March 17, 2021",2020-06-20,No,No,Yes,No,"Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Bogotá, Colombia|Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, United States|Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan, United States|Lowell General Hospital Cancer Center, Lowell, Massachusetts, United States|Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States|Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, United States|Miami Cancer Institute, Miami, Florida, United States|Boca Raton Regional Hospital Lynn Cancer Institute, Boca Raton, Florida, United States",8,Yes,No,Allocation: Randomized|Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment|Primary Purpose: Treatment|Masked: None (Open Label),3.0,,Treatment,Parallel Assignment,,Randomized,None (Open Label),No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,50 Years,,All,,,No,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia - Currently hospitalized with COVID-19 - Symptomatic fever, cough and/or dyspnea for < 9 days - Patient or legal/authorized representative can understand and sign the study informed consent document - Able to be positioned on a linear-accelerator couch for Radiation Therapy delivery - And at least one of the following risk factors for significant pulmonary compromise: 1.

The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib plus standard pharmacologic and supportive measures in treating hospitalized participants with COVID-19 pneumonia.,"COVID-19 is a viral disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that can cause severe pneumonia and ARDS. Respiratory viral load may peak within 5 days after onset, while symptoms are still mild. Many patients rapidly (within 1 to 2 weeks of infection) develop dyspnea and pneumonia and require hospitalization for respiratory support. Preliminary clinical data from COVID-19 patients indicate that severe symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with an exaggerated immune response driven by interleukin (IL)-6 IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, and other cytokines. The ultimate result is progressive destruction of the alveolar epithelium leading to pneumonia and/or ARDS. Moreover, the exudative phase of ARDS is thought to be due to an influx of myeloid cells (neutrophils and macrophages) and elevations of inflammatory cytokines, with higher levels of both IL-6 and IL-8 levels being correlated with increased mortality. Therefore, immunomodulatory therapy may be beneficial in reducing the deleterious effects of lung inflammation and mitigating progressive lung injury. Tofacitinib is an inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAKs) 1 and 3, with partial selectivity to JAK 2. Tofacitinib suppresses pro-inflammatory signaling that may be important pathogenetically to progression to more severe lung disease and ARDS in patients with COVID-19. The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib plus standard pharmacologic and supportive measures in treating hospitalized participants with COVID-19 pneumonia. Participants with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as determined by a positive PCR or other commercially available or public health assay, who have agreed to participate, will be screened within 72h hours after admission to the hospital to determine eligibility.

These blood clots can lead to individuals being admitted to hospital, or, unfortunately in severe cases, death. Enoxaparin is a blood-thinning drug which has been used by doctors and nurses in hospitals for many years to prevent the thickening of blood which may lead to a clot. It is easier for doctors to prevent new blood clots from forming than treating existing blood clots. Currently, there are no treatments for COVID-19. There is an urgent need to find a safe and effective treatment to prevent worsening of the disease that may lead to hospital admission and/or death. The ETHIC (Early Thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19) study aims to find out if giving enoxaparin in an early stage of the COVID-19 disease can prevent individuals being admitted to hospital and/or death. The study will take place in approximately 8 to 10 countries, in approximately 30 to 50 centres. Patients will be allowed to take part if they have had a confirmed COVID-19 infection, are ≥ 55 years of age and have at least two of the following additional risk factors; age ≥ 70 years, body mass index > 25 kg/m2, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or corticosteroid use. Half the patients in the study will receive the blood-thinning drug enoxaparin for three weeks, and half will receive no treatment. Individuals will be randomly allocated to one of these groups. After 21 days, the number of patients in each group who were either admitted to hospital, or died, will be compared. The number of patients in each group who developed a blood clot (venous thromboembolism) will also be compared. Further comparisons will be made at both 50 and 90 days after the beginning of the study.","This is an open label randomized controlled trial of symptomatic individuals with confirmed COVID-19 in a community setting. Justification: There is currently no standard of care treatment for Covid-19. Upon enrolment into the study, patients will be randomised to receive either enoxaparin (40 mg once per day if < 100 kg, 40 mg twice per day if ≥ 100 kg) or the current standard of care (no enoxaparin) for three weeks (21 days). Randomisation must occur within 5 days of the SARS-CoV-2 test. Data will be collected at baseline and 21 days, with further assessments at 50 and 90 days. Participants randomised to enoxaparin will receive pre-loaded syringes as part of the study, and information regarding self-administration will be provided by the sponsor. Participants in the control arm of this study will receive no treatment (current standard of care). Screening Phase: Investigator sites will be selected to represent community care in each country (from general practice/office based care settings, testing centres and hospitals) and invited to participate. All individuals satisfying the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered for enrolment and their medical history checked to exclude any patients not suitable. Participants will be provided with a patient information sheet and consent form (PISCF), either paper or an electronic version. All participants must provide informed consent by reviewing and discussing the PISCF and by completing and signing the consent form (paper version or the electronic version). Once informed consent has been obtained, data related to baseline will be collected from a review of the participants' medical records and entered into the electronic data capture system. Treatment Phase: Data related to clinical outcomes for both the primary outcome (composite of hospitalisation and/or death) and secondary safety outcome (major bleeding) will be measured at 21 days. This time point will be used as a marker for collection of all data from the preceding period. Safety and Monitoring Phase: Data related to all outcomes will be again measured at 50 days. This time point will be used as a marker for collection of all data from the preceding period to evaluate the incidence of bleeding in all participants. End of Study and Follow-up Phase: The outcomes of death and hospitalisation will be further recorded 90 days after randomisation. This time point will be used as a marker for collection of all information from the interim period. The end of the trial will occur immediately following the last visit/data item of the last patient undergoing the trial. The aim of data collection will be to accurately capture all planned and unplanned visits, interruptions to treatment and events. In case no patient data have been recorded in the participant's medical records at the site during the months following the last data entry, a follow-up phone contact will be made by the site and documented to verify that all events are being captured and participants are not lost to follow up.

The influence of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the coagulation is hypothesized to be regulated by platelet activation, proinflammatory cytokines, endothelial cell injury and stasis. The elevated levels of d-dimer and fibrinogen and clinical signs of organ damage point to a significant hypercoagulable state.

It has been demonstrated that patients with acute respiratory infections are at elevated risk for acute myocardial infarction after influenza (incidence ratio [IR] 6.1, 95% CI 3.9-9.5) and after non-influenza viral illnesses including other coronavirus species (IR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.2). Tantry et al. proposed a mechanistic link between inflammation and heightened thrombogenicity in the presence of unstable CVD state. Furthermore, investigators have hypothesized that this thrombo-inflammatory state becomes even more relevant when patients with CVD and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).A similar scenario may be present during COVID-19 infection, where evidence of an early myonecrosis may be related to fundamental changes in pathways affecting thrombosis. However, currently, there is no information on how COVID-19 influences hemostasis/thrombosis pathways and subsequent adverse clinical event occurrences. Cardiovascular comorbidities including hypertension, obesity, high cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus are common in patients with COVID-19 and such patients are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality.12 Furthermore, emerging demographic data in COVID-19 patients shows that incidence and mortality is disproportionately higher in African Americans and Latinos. In a study conducted at Sinai hospital, Lev et al. analyzed a large cohort of racially diverse patients (n=1,172) with CAD or CV risk and demonstrated that sex and race are significantly associated with platelet-fibrin clot strength, a marker of hypercoagulability. Most interesting, AA women had the highest thrombogenicity profile, potentially conferring a highrisk phenotype for thrombotic event occurrence. Furthermore, in a study entitled, ""PlateletReactivity in Different Ethnicities"" also conducted at Sinai hospital, investigators have demonstrated that Latino and AA races had the highest platelet-fibrin clot strength as compared to Caucasians and others races studied.The latter findings may be described by difference in frequency of a single-nucleotide variant in protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR-4) between AA and Caucasians respectively (63% vs 19%). PAR-4 is an active thrombin receptor on human platelets essential for thrombin-induced platelet activation and has been shown to be more active in African Americans as compared to Caucasians. This evidence may provide a potential mechanistic explanation for racial disparities observed in COVID-19 patients and require further investigation. Hence, investigators will collect a genetic sample to analyze single-nucleotide variant of PAR-4 and other genetic markers related to thrombosis. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a method for measuring global hemostasis and has been widely used in surgery and anesthesiology, emergency departments, trauma centers, intensive care units,and cardiac catheterization labs for transfusion management, prediction of thrombotic and bleeding events, and choice/adjustment of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies. Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) is a widely used gold standard method for identifying heightened platelet reactivity to various agonists, a marker of thrombotic risk.More common conventional coagulation tests include prothrombin time (PT, INR), partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, platelet count, and d-dimer. However, these latter tests do not reflect interactions between platelets, endothelium, and fibrinolytic factors and must be used in combination to provide a complete picture of hemostasis status. Unlike these tests, the TEG can assess platelet function, clot strength, and fibrinolysis. Furthermore, The TEG6s Hemostasis Analyzer is a portable, all-in-one cartridge-based system that requires minimal blood sample and minimal sample processing, a potential safety advantage when processing blood samples in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, COVID-19 infection may be associated with acute cardiac injury as indicated by elevation of cardiac biomarkers to > 99th percentile of the upper reference limit, but also electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities. Cardiac injury is highly prevalent in patients with COVID-19 but may not be an important marker as it occurs after damage has been done. Inosine and hypoxanthine are specific markers of acute cardiac ischemia (ACI) that are measurable within 20 minutes as compared to 4 hours with CKMB and Troponin testing. Investigators believe that this marker may indicate the early presence of micro-thrombi and organ damage. Investigators plan to investigate these novel markers in this trial. Investigators hypothesize that COVID-19 is a heightened prothrombotic/hypercoagulability state that can be characterized using platelet function testing and Thromboelastography. More information is required to study the effect of COVID-19 on coagulation and platelet pathways to develop effective antithrombotic treatment strategies. The study is a multi-center, non-interventional study involving laboratory testing of blood samples and data collection for a COVID registry using electronic medical records. The study specific laboratory assessments will be obtained at baseline (closest to time of hospitalization), Day 3 and Day 8 from baseline, and at hospital discharge. Patients will be followed for clinical events during hospitalization, and 1 and 6 months after discharge.

It was declared as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 and since that time there have been outbreaks on every continent except for Antarctica. Preliminary understanding of the virus suggests that some fraction of the population does not manifest clinical disease in response to infection, others manifest a relatively benign course of illness, and still others develop a fulminant course that eventuates in the need for intensive care, mechanical ventilation, or even death. The genetic and epigenetic basis for differential susceptibility remains unknown. Patients receiving hemodialysis provide a good opportunity to understand genetic and epigenetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. By virtue of their ongoing requirements for care, such patients cannot shelter at home or maintain social distancing, but must instead report to a clinical care setting on a thrice weekly basis. Moreover, such patients often travel to and from dialysis using shared ride services, which furthers opportunity for exposure. Preliminary estimates suggest that rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity are 2 to 5-fold higher among hemodialysis patients than in the general public.

Participants in the study will be treated with either a study drug plus current standard of care (SOC), or with placebo plus current SOC.","This is a master protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational agents aimed at modifying the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or directly enhancing viral control in order to limit disease progression. The protocol is for a randomized, blinded, controlled platform study that allows investigational drugs to be added and dropped during the course of the study. This allows for efficient testing of new drugs against placebo and standard of care (SOC) treatment within the same study. When more than one drug is being tested at the same time, participants will be randomly allocated to treatments or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by study site pharmacy and disease severity. There are 2 disease severity strata: Participants without organ failure (severity stratum 1); and participants with organ failure (severity stratum 2). An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly review interim analyses and summarize safety and efficacy outcomes. For investigational drugs with minimal pre-existing safety knowledge, the pace of enrollment with be initially restricted, and there will be an early review of safety data by the DSMB. For the study of each agent, at the outset of the trial, only participants in disease severity stratum 1 will be enrolled. This will continue until approximately 300 participants are enrolled and followed for 5 days. The exact number will vary according to the speed of enrollment and the timing of DSMB meetings. Prior to expanding enrollment to also include patients in disease severity stratum 2, safety will be evaluated and a pre-specified futility assessment by the DSMB will be carried out using 2 ordinal outcomes assessed at Day 5. Both ordinal outcomes are used to assess futility because it is currently unclear whether the investigational agents under study will primarily influence non-pulmonary outcomes, for which risk is increased with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in part, through mechanisms that may be different from those that influence pulmonary outcomes. For investigational agents passing this futility assessment, enrollment of participants will be expanded, seamlessly and without any data unblinding, to include participants in disease severity stratum 2 as well as those in disease severity stratum 1. Future interim analyses will be based on the primary endpoint of sustained recovery and will use pre-specified guidelines to determine early evidence of benefit, harm or futility for the investigational agent. Participants will be followed for 18 months following randomization. The international trials within this protocol will be conducted in several hundred clinical sites. Participating sites are affiliated with networks funded by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs.",Covid19,ACTIV3|ACTIV-3|SARS Coronavirus|SARS-CoV-2|Nidovirales Infections|Virus Diseases|RNA Virus Infections|Coronavirus Infections|Coronaviridae Infections|COVID 19|COVID-19,Biological: AZD7442|Biological: BRII-196/BRII-198|Biological: VIR-7831|Biological: Remdesivir|Drug: Placebo|Biological: LY3819253,Biological:AZD7442:600 mg AZD7442 (300 mg AZD8895 + 300 mg AZD1061).

Participants in the study will be treated with either a study drug plus current standard of care (SOC), or with placebo plus current SOC.","This is a master protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational agents aimed at modifying the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or directly enhancing viral control in order to limit disease progression. The protocol is for a randomized, blinded, controlled platform study that allows investigational drugs to be added and dropped during the course of the study. This allows for efficient testing of new drugs against placebo and standard of care (SOC) treatment within the same study. When more than one drug is being tested at the same time, participants will be randomly allocated to treatments or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by study site pharmacy and disease severity. There are 2 disease severity strata: Participants without organ failure (severity stratum 1); and participants with organ failure (severity stratum 2). An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly review interim analyses and summarize safety and efficacy outcomes. For investigational drugs with minimal pre-existing safety knowledge, the pace of enrollment with be initially restricted, and there will be an early review of safety data by the DSMB. For the study of each agent, at the outset of the trial, only participants in disease severity stratum 1 will be enrolled. This will continue until approximately 300 participants are enrolled and followed for 5 days. The exact number will vary according to the speed of enrollment and the timing of DSMB meetings. Prior to expanding enrollment to also include patients in disease severity stratum 2, safety will be evaluated and a pre-specified futility assessment by the DSMB will be carried out using 2 ordinal outcomes assessed at Day 5. Both ordinal outcomes are used to assess futility because it is currently unclear whether the investigational agents under study will primarily influence non-pulmonary outcomes, for which risk is increased with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in part, through mechanisms that may be different from those that influence pulmonary outcomes. For investigational agents passing this futility assessment, enrollment of participants will be expanded, seamlessly and without any data unblinding, to include participants in disease severity stratum 2 as well as those in disease severity stratum 1. Future interim analyses will be based on the primary endpoint of sustained recovery and will use pre-specified guidelines to determine early evidence of benefit, harm or futility for the investigational agent. Participants will be followed for 18 months following randomization. The international trials within this protocol will be conducted in several hundred clinical sites. Participating sites are affiliated with networks funded by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs.",Covid19,ACTIV3|ACTIV-3|SARS Coronavirus|SARS-CoV-2|Nidovirales Infections|Virus Diseases|RNA Virus Infections|Coronavirus Infections|Coronaviridae Infections|COVID 19|COVID-19,Biological: AZD7442|Biological: BRII-196/BRII-198|Biological: VIR-7831|Biological: Remdesivir|Drug: Placebo|Biological: LY3819253,Biological:AZD7442:600 mg AZD7442 (300 mg AZD8895 + 300 mg AZD1061).

Participants in the study will be treated with either a study drug plus current standard of care (SOC), or with placebo plus current SOC.","This is a master protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational agents aimed at modifying the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or directly enhancing viral control in order to limit disease progression. The protocol is for a randomized, blinded, controlled platform study that allows investigational drugs to be added and dropped during the course of the study. This allows for efficient testing of new drugs against placebo and standard of care (SOC) treatment within the same study. When more than one drug is being tested at the same time, participants will be randomly allocated to treatments or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by study site pharmacy and disease severity. There are 2 disease severity strata: Participants without organ failure (severity stratum 1); and participants with organ failure (severity stratum 2). An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will regularly review interim analyses and summarize safety and efficacy outcomes. For investigational drugs with minimal pre-existing safety knowledge, the pace of enrollment with be initially restricted, and there will be an early review of safety data by the DSMB. For the study of each agent, at the outset of the trial, only participants in disease severity stratum 1 will be enrolled. This will continue until approximately 300 participants are enrolled and followed for 5 days. The exact number will vary according to the speed of enrollment and the timing of DSMB meetings. Prior to expanding enrollment to also include patients in disease severity stratum 2, safety will be evaluated and a pre-specified futility assessment by the DSMB will be carried out using 2 ordinal outcomes assessed at Day 5. Both ordinal outcomes are used to assess futility because it is currently unclear whether the investigational agents under study will primarily influence non-pulmonary outcomes, for which risk is increased with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in part, through mechanisms that may be different from those that influence pulmonary outcomes. For investigational agents passing this futility assessment, enrollment of participants will be expanded, seamlessly and without any data unblinding, to include participants in disease severity stratum 2 as well as those in disease severity stratum 1. Future interim analyses will be based on the primary endpoint of sustained recovery and will use pre-specified guidelines to determine early evidence of benefit, harm or futility for the investigational agent.

(Gordon et al, Nature). While anti-viral activity may be contributing to the observational associations of reduced severity of Covid-19, metformin has a proven history of beneficial immune-modulatory effects, including on CRP, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, neutrophil extracellular traps, and improved T cell immunity. Outpatient metformin use has now been associated with lower IL-6, CRP, and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio in persons with Covid-19. While vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 has been promising, there may be reduced willingness among the public to receive a vaccine developed so quickly.

The intent is to follow with a PH III randomized controlled clinical trial to assess the capacity for PVP-I nasal swabs to mitigate the transmission of respiratory viruses specifically COVID 19.,"Specific Aim 1: Evaluate toxicity and tolerability of PVP-I nasal swabs Specific Aim 2: Investigate the dosing of PVP-I nasal swabs. Hypothesis 1: PVP-I nasal swabs have a low toxicity, low side effect profile, and high tolerability with daily use. Hypothesis 2: Twice a day dosing for six weeks will prove safe in this subject population. Healthy volunteers living in the Boston area between the ages of 18 and 70 years old will be recruited for participation in this study. Consenting subjects will undergo baseline testing to confirm participants eligibility for this trial. As mentioned above, the target for enrollment is 50 subjects, so it is anticipated that approximately 75 subjects will be recruited, consented, and screened/tested, with about 25 of those subjects being either ineligible after testing or unable to complete the full 12 weeks of the trial. Subjects will apply 3M's PVP-I nasal swabs either once (control group) or twice (treatment group) per day, depending on the group that participants are randomized into. Subjects will apply the nasal swabs daily for six weeks with weekly symptom assessments and testing. After subjects cease nasal swab application, participants will return after another six weeks (i.e. 12 weeks after participants first nasal swab application) for a final round of testing and symptom assessment. Subjects will not need to pay for any nasal swabs or visits during this trial - all study-related items and visits will be covered by the sponsor. Subjects will also be remunerated with up to 100 dollars in gift certificates if participants complete the study and attend the check-ins (50 dollar certificate for completing baseline visit and 50 dollar certificate for coming in at 12 weeks). Baseline screening will assess the overall health of the subject, confirm that participants have no underlying cardiac or thyroid conditions, participants are not pregnant (serum hCG testing will confirm this) nor intend to conceive during the course of this trial, and that participants are not experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. coughing, fever, shortness of breath). Further, testing will include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody, serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; to test for pregnancy), urine iodine, and COVID-19 mRNA (for the presence of an active virus) and antibody (as evidence for previous COVID-19 infection). Some of these tests will be administered weekly, at baseline only, at six weeks, or at 12 weeks. All research-related phlebotomy for this study will take place at BWH clinical research phlebotomy labs, such as the Clinical Trials Hub at 60 Fenwood Road or the Clinical Trials Center at 15 Francis Street. Again, all tests are covered by study funding and subjects will never be charged for them. Once subjects' test results are returned and participants are deemed eligible for the study, participants will meet with the investigator in a clinical exam room (with masks and 6 feet social distance), and the investigator will demonstrate how to apply the nasal swabs so that the subject can continue to apply the swabs by themselves for the duration of the study. The investigator will assure that the subject has learned how to apply the nasal swab correctly and safely and that the subject understands the importance of daily, regimented application. Alternatively, if the subject would prefer to minimize in-person contact with others, participants can obtain the study drug from the investigator or study staff and learn how to apply the swabs through a Zoom meeting. Further, a video detailing these instructions will be sent to subjects with detailed application instructions. Subjects will also be given a questionnaire to fill out at each weekly check-in, which will assess any side effects participants may be experiencing related to this drug (questionnaire is attached to this IRB submission on Insight). Questions will be focused on symptoms of hyperthyroidism (e.g. palpitations, tremulousness, weight loss, irritability) and hypothyroidism (e.g. fatigue, weight gain, sluggishness, hair loss). Subjects will also be informed at the time of enrollment that if participants start experiencing any troubling side effects, participants should stop applying swabs and alert study staff or an investigator of these side effects as soon as participants can. If this happens, or if a subject's test results reveal markers that are outside of reference ranges, participants will be withdrawn from the study and investigators will explain why participants are being withdrawn. Investigators will closely monitor the safety of patients and alert the FDA and the BWH IRB if any adverse events occur. However, given the proven safety of PVP-I and the weekly testing and assessments the investigators are conducting, the investigators do not anticipate that any adverse events will occur. The overall study, from initiation and patient recruitment to data analysis and synthesis of a detailed report is anticipated to take six months.",Covid19|Povidone Iodine Adverse Reaction,,Drug: Povidine iodine nasal swabs,Drug:Povidine iodine nasal swabs:Daily versus twice daily nasal application,Experimental:Safety Analysis:Evaluate safety of PVP-I nasal swabs single daily application|Experimental:Tolerability analysis:Investigate the dosing of PVP-I nasal swabs daily single dosing versus double dosing,Experimental[Safety Analysis]:Drug[Povidine iodine nasal swabs]|Experimental[Tolerability analysis]:Drug[Povidine iodine nasal swabs],"Number of participants with treatment-related adverse events as assessed by self reporting, metabolic and endocrine metrics|Number of participants with dose dependent side effects determined by self reporting diaries, thyroid and metabolic testing",2020-08-31,2021-02-28,2021-04-30,2020-08-12,,2020-08-12,"ClinicalTrials.gov processed this data on January 29, 2021",2020-08-10,No,Yes,No,No,,0,No,No,Allocation: Non-Randomized|Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment|Primary Purpose: Prevention|Masked: None (Open Label),2.0,,Prevention,Parallel Assignment,,Non-Randomized,None (Open Label),No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,18 Years,70 Years,All,,,Accepts Healthy Volunteers,,"Inclusion Criteria: 1.

The study Sponsor hypothesize's that the early initiation of p38α/β inhibitor therapy in patients hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 who are at increased risk of a poor prognosis based on older age and elevated systemic inflammation will reduce clinical deterioration including progression to respiratory failure and death. To address this hypothesis, Fulcrum Therapeutics is conducting a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of losmapimod versus placebo in subjects 50 and older who are hospitalized with moderate COVID-19 disease.","The therapeutic hypothesis for the use of losmapimod in COVID-19 disease is that increased disease severity and consequent increased mortality is caused by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated exaggerated acute inflammatory response resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is anticipated that the early initiation of p38α/β inhibitor therapy in patients with moderate COVID-19 will prevent further clinical deterioration and reduce the need for both increased respiratory support as well as mortality. This is the main hypothesis for this study. To address this hypothesis, Fulcrum Therapeutics is conducting a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of losmapimod versus placebo in subjects with COVID-19 disease. Losmapimod is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) and has previously been administered to more than 3600 adult healthy volunteers and subjects including participants in a large Phase 3 trial which looked at clinical outcomes and safety after major cardiovascular events. Patients will participate in this study for approximately 34 days. The total treatment duration will be 14 days. Subjects will be evaluated during a 3 day pre-treatment period (Screening and Baseline Visits) to establish pre-treatment baseline assessments and eligibility. Subjects will then be randomized to treatment with losmapimod or placebo for 14 days and assessed frequently for changes from pre-treatment in various clinical outcome assessments. Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by viral PCR prior to randomization and first dosing. Patients will receive 15 mg of losmapimod, or placebo twice daily given as two 7.5 mg tablets per dose by mouth: for a total of 4 pills or 30 mg daily for 14 consecutive days. All study visits during the first week of treatment are anticipated to be conducted in the inpatient setting while later visits are anticipated to be conducted as outpatient. The primary endpoint of the study is to assess the efficacy of losmapimod tablets compared with placebo for the treatment of COVID-19 when administered concurrently with the local standard of care. Secondary endpoints include evaluating the effect of losmapimod compared with placebo on clinical outcomes, clinical status, effect on survival, safety, and tolerability and to characterize changes in the levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",COVID-19,2019 novel coronavirus infection|2019 novel coronavirus disease|coronavirus disease 2019|SARS-CoV-2 infection|COVID-19 virus infection|COVID-19 virus disease|COVID-19 pandemic,Drug: Placebo oral tablet|Drug: Losmapimod oral tablet,Drug:Placebo oral tablet:This study includes a 14-day treatment period.

At present, there are no known treatments for COVID-19. Whilst, the anticipated scale of the epidemic is such that hospitals, and particularly intensive care facilities, may be massively overstretched. As described by a few models of pandemic spread, up to 50% of the adult population may fall sick over a period of 8-12 weeks, of whom around 10% may require hospitalisation. This figure could imply nearly 2 million hospital admissions. Considering this scenario, therapies which may only have a moderate impact on survival or on hospital resources could be worthwhile. Critically, the present trial design has been developed with consideration of the front-line hospital staff working within an overstretched care system in these unprecedented times. To minimise their burden the protocol is deliberately flexible so that it is suitable for a wide range of settings, allowing: - a broad range of patients to be enrolled (patient pathway, disease stage or mode of diagnosis) - Additional sub-studies may be added to provide more detailed information on side effects or sub-categorisation of patient types but these are not the primary objective and are not required for participation. - To be able to include more sites: the investigators will initiate the trial as a single centre (UHCW) and more sites invited to participate according to the emerging evidence - The investigator have included 'Exploratory and Secondary objectives' in the protocol however, in consideration of the circumstances the research activities will emulate investigations performed as per standard care/routines care to minimise any burden on the delivery teams.

Of patients admitted to the ICU, upwards of 85% developed the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and most if not all required mechanical ventilation. The beneficial effects of prone positioning for ARDS have been well described. Coupling the reported benefits of prone positioning in COVID-19 associated ARDS patients with the known beneficial effects of early prone-positioning in the treatment of ARDS, it is not surprising that many hospital systems are advocating prone positioning for treatment of ARDS in patients with COVID-19. However, as the pandemic continues to progress in the United States and the number of new cases grows as new clusters emerge, the possibility of 'rationing' ventilators becomes more real. Therefore, therapies that prevent the need for mechanical ventilation are desperately needed. Given the distinct benefit that patients with COVID-19 have with prone positioning, the overarching hypothesis of this trial is that patients with high risk for respiratory failure may also benefit from prone positioning.","Pneumonia, Viral|Covid19",prone positioning|pneumonia|covid19|COVID,Other: Prone Positioning,Other:Prone Positioning:Prone Positioning,No Intervention:Control - Usual Care:Usual Care|Experimental:Intervention - Prone Positioning:Prone Positioning,Experimental[Intervention - Prone Positioning]:Other[Prone Positioning],Occurrence of an escalation in respiratory related care (yes vs no)|Oxygen Saturation|Respiratory Effort as assessed by Respiratory Rate,2020-09-01,2021-12-31,2021-12-31,2020-08-18,,2020-10-12,"ClinicalTrials.gov processed this data on January 29, 2021",2020-08-14,No,No,No,No,"Johns Hopkins Univeristy, Baltimore, Maryland, United States|University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States|Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, United States|UPMC, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States",4,Yes,No,Allocation: Randomized|Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment|Primary Purpose: Treatment|Masked: None (Open Label),2.0,,Treatment,Parallel Assignment,,Randomized,None (Open Label),No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,18 Years,,All,,,No,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Age ≥ 18 years - COVID-19 positive by nasopharyngeal swab or serostatus - Use of supplemental oxygen OR respiratory rate ≥ 20 Exclusion Criteria: - BMI ≥ 45 kg/m2 - Pregnancy - Chest tube placement - Hemodynamic instability with mean arterial pressure < 60 mmHg - Thoracic or abdominal wounds - Chest wall deformities - Vertebral column deformities that would preclude prone positioning - Facial trauma or surgery in the last 30 days - Established diagnosis of interstitial lung disease - Prior single or double lung transplant - Surgery for spine, femur, or pelvis in the last 3 months - Thoracic or cardiac surgery in the last 30 days - Pacemaker placement last 7 days",No,,Smith & Nephew,SNN

Phase III evaluation is a continuation of the phase II trial for agents that meet study-defined criteria for further evaluation and for which sufficient investigational agent is available. An infused agent may also enter directly into phase III evaluation based on Trial Oversight Committee (TOC) assessments. For non-infused agents, the same phase II study will be undertaken as for infused agents. Following design of the phase III evaluation for non-infused agents in a subsequent version or amendment of the protocol these may also enter directly into phase III based on TOC assessments.

There is currently an urgent need for one study to efficiently test multiple drugs from more than one company, in people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but who do not currently need hospitalization. This could help prevent disease progression to more serious symptoms and complications, and spread of COVID-19 in the community. This study looks at the safety and effectiveness of different drugs in treating COVID-19 in outpatients. Participants in the study will be treated with either a study drug or with placebo and will have 28 days of intensive follow-up following study drug administration, followed by limited follow-up through 24 weeks. Study visits may be required after week 24 depending on the study agent.","This is a master protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational agents aimed at modifying the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or directly enhancing viral control in order to limit disease progression. The study includes both infused and non-infused agents. For infused agents, enrollment will be restricted to participants at higher risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Non-infused agents will be open to participants at both ""higher"" and ""lower"" risk of progression to severe COVID-19. For infused agents, the study begins with a phase II evaluation, followed by a transition into a larger Phase III evaluation for promising agents. Phase III evaluation is a continuation of the phase II trial for agents that meet study-defined criteria for further evaluation and for which sufficient investigational agent is available. An infused agent may also enter directly into phase III evaluation based on Trial Oversight Committee (TOC) assessments. For non-infused agents, the same phase II study will be undertaken as for infused agents. Following design of the phase III evaluation for non-infused agents in a subsequent version or amendment of the protocol these may also enter directly into phase III based on TOC assessments. Investigational agents will be selected by the TOC for phase II evaluation based on the presence of in vitro data demonstrating promise as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics in pre-clinical testing, and for which there are suitable pharmacokinetics and safety data from phase I testing, or through clinical or research testing for a different indication, and agent availability.",Covid19|Coronavirus,ACTIV2|ACTIV-2|SARS Coronavirus|SARS-CoV-2|Nidovirales Infections|Virus Diseases|RNA Virus Infections|Coronavirus Infections|Coronaviridae Infections|COVID 19|Coronavirus|COVID-19,Drug: Placebo (SC injections)|Biological: C135-LS + C144-LS|Drug: Placebo (oral tablet)|Drug: Placebo (Inhaled solution)|Drug: Placebo (IM)|Drug: Camostat|Drug: SNG001|Biological: AZD7442 (IM)|Biological: AZD7442 (IV)|Biological: BRII-196/BRII-198|Drug: Placebo (IV)|Biological: bamlanivimab,"Drug:Placebo (SC injections):Administered SC as 4 separate injections for one dose.|Biological:C135-LS + C144-LS:Administered subcutaneously (SC) as 4 separate injections for one dose (two injections of C135-LS 200mg and two injections of C144-SL 200mg).|Drug:Placebo (oral tablet):200 mg (2 x 100 mg) film-coated tablets administered orally every 6 hours for 7 days.|Drug:Placebo (Inhaled solution):Trisodium citrate dihydrate, di-sodium hydrogen-phosphate, sodium dihydrogen-phosphate dihydrate, racemic methionine (DL-methionine) and water. 1.3 mL solution administered once daily for 14 days using Aerogen Ultra nebulizer (inhalation device).|Drug:Placebo (IM):Commercially available 0.9% sodium chloride Injection, USP.

There is currently an urgent need for one study to efficiently test multiple drugs from more than one company, in people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but who do not currently need hospitalization. This could help prevent disease progression to more serious symptoms and complications, and spread of COVID-19 in the community. This study looks at the safety and effectiveness of different drugs in treating COVID-19 in outpatients. Participants in the study will be treated with either a study drug or with placebo and will have 28 days of intensive follow-up following study drug administration, followed by limited follow-up through 24 weeks. Study visits may be required after week 24 depending on the study agent.","This is a master protocol to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational agents aimed at modifying the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, or directly enhancing viral control in order to limit disease progression. The study includes both infused and non-infused agents. For infused agents, enrollment will be restricted to participants at higher risk of progression to severe COVID-19. Non-infused agents will be open to participants at both ""higher"" and ""lower"" risk of progression to severe COVID-19. For infused agents, the study begins with a phase II evaluation, followed by a transition into a larger Phase III evaluation for promising agents. Phase III evaluation is a continuation of the phase II trial for agents that meet study-defined criteria for further evaluation and for which sufficient investigational agent is available. An infused agent may also enter directly into phase III evaluation based on Trial Oversight Committee (TOC) assessments. For non-infused agents, the same phase II study will be undertaken as for infused agents. Following design of the phase III evaluation for non-infused agents in a subsequent version or amendment of the protocol these may also enter directly into phase III based on TOC assessments. Investigational agents will be selected by the TOC for phase II evaluation based on the presence of in vitro data demonstrating promise as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics in pre-clinical testing, and for which there are suitable pharmacokinetics and safety data from phase I testing, or through clinical or research testing for a different indication, and agent availability.",Covid19|Coronavirus,ACTIV2|ACTIV-2|SARS Coronavirus|SARS-CoV-2|Nidovirales Infections|Virus Diseases|RNA Virus Infections|Coronavirus Infections|Coronaviridae Infections|COVID 19|Coronavirus|COVID-19,Drug: Placebo (SC injections)|Biological: C135-LS + C144-LS|Drug: Placebo (oral tablet)|Drug: Placebo (Inhaled solution)|Drug: Placebo (IM)|Drug: Camostat|Drug: SNG001|Biological: AZD7442 (IM)|Biological: AZD7442 (IV)|Biological: BRII-196/BRII-198|Drug: Placebo (IV)|Biological: bamlanivimab,"Drug:Placebo (SC injections):Administered SC as 4 separate injections for one dose.|Biological:C135-LS + C144-LS:Administered subcutaneously (SC) as 4 separate injections for one dose (two injections of C135-LS 200mg and two injections of C144-SL 200mg).|Drug:Placebo (oral tablet):200 mg (2 x 100 mg) film-coated tablets administered orally every 6 hours for 7 days.|Drug:Placebo (Inhaled solution):Trisodium citrate dihydrate, di-sodium hydrogen-phosphate, sodium dihydrogen-phosphate dihydrate, racemic methionine (DL-methionine) and water. 1.3 mL solution administered once daily for 14 days using Aerogen Ultra nebulizer (inhalation device).|Drug:Placebo (IM):Commercially available 0.9% sodium chloride Injection, USP.

This study will be conducted in two parts; Stage I - Main study and Stage II - Extended Follow up.","Stage I - Main Study: All the eligible patients will be randomized to receive either favipiravir + supportive care or placebo + supportive care. The treatment duration with the IMP will be for a period of 10 consecutive days. If the patient is discharged before Day 10, the patient will be required to continue the remainder of the treatment course of the assigned IMP at home. Patients in both the groups will receive supportive care, as appropriate. The duration of supportive care will be based upon Investigator's judgement and as per individual patient's requirement. The study data collection period will be up to 28 (+2) days. Day 10 will be considered as the End of treatment (EOT) assessment. 1. If the patient remains in the hospital until Day 10, the EOT will be performed at the site and all the scheduled assessments for Day 10 will be performed 2. If the patient is discharged before Day 10, the EOT can be performed either as an onsite visit or will be performed at the patient's home : 1. On-site visit: If the patient is able to visit the hospital on Day 10, procedures for an unscheduled visit will be performed. OR 2. At home: If the patient is unable to visit the hospital for the EOT, study nurse or phlebotomist will visit the patient at his/her residence to collect blood sample for safety assessments. A telephonic follow up will be performed to enquire on treatment emergent AEs experienced, concomitant medication and COVID-19 associated symptom for assessment of clinical relapse. Day 28 will be considered the end of study visit. If patient is discharged from the hospital before Day 28, the assessments mentioned in the end of study visit (Day 28) will be performed before the patient is discharged. After discharge, telephonic follow up will be performed on Day 10 (applicable only for patients who are discharged earlier than Day 10 and if patients are unable to visit the site for EOT on Day 10), Day 14, Day 21 and Day 28. The telephonic follow up will be as applicable for the individual patient, depending upon the actual day when (s)he is discharged. A 2-day window period is allowed for telephonic follow up. In case the patient remains admitted in the hospital beyond Study Day 28, the end of study assessments will be performed for the patient on Day 28 (+2) days. Stage I of the study will be completed when the 'Day 28' assessment is completed either as an in-patient assessment if the patient is still hospitalized, or as a telephonic follow up assessment if the patients are discharged earlier to Day 28.

While much of the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 has been attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or end-organ failure, emerging data suggest that disorders of coagulation, in particular hypercoagulability and venous thromboembolism (VTE), may represent an additional major, and possibly preventable, complication (Wu C, et al. JAMA Intern Med. 2020 Mar 13. [Epub ahead of print] and Tang N, et al. Thromb. Haemost. 2020 Feb 19. [EPub Ahead of Print]). Abnormal coagulation testing results, especially markedly elevated D-dimer and FDP, have been associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19 infection. We propose the following Electronic Health Record (EHR)-guided 10000-patient, retrospective observational cohort study to assess VTE incidence, risk factors, prevention and management patterns, and thrombotic outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. In order to gain the valuable perspective of other regional and national centers providing care for large populations of COVID-19, we have started a collaborative network with 5 additional sites which will provide us with de-identified data from 1000 patients each. These 5000 patients in addition to the 5000-patient cohort we are enrolling within the Mass General Brigham Network will comprise this study population.","Aim #1: To determine the 30-day and 90-day frequencies of adjudicated, symptomatic arterial and venous thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19 infection. Symptomatic VTE is defined as symptomatic DVT or PE, confirmed by imaging, within 30 days of randomization. Arterial thromboembolism will be comprised of myocardial infarction, stroke or systemic embolism, acute limb ischemia. Aim #2: To determine VTE-related risk factors, prevention and management patterns, and 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality, bleeding, and thrombotic outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection. 30- and 90-day bleeding outcomes will include ISTH-major and clinically-relevant nonmajor bleeding. Thrombotic outcomes will include symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, stroke or systemic embolism, acute limb ischemia, and cardiovascular death. Aim #3: To determine through multivariate logistic regression modeling, independent risk factors for VTE in patients with COVID-19 infection that could be used to identify those who may benefit from thromboprophylaxis during hospitalization and after discharge. Study Design: 10000 patient U.S.-based EHR-guided, retrospective observational cohort analysis. Data will abstracted through the EHR. Because this is a computer-generated observational retrospective registry, informed consent will not be practical. Accordingly, we will ask our Institutional Review Board to waive the requirement for informed consent. Participating sites (University of Colorado, Jefferson Health, BIDMC, Anne Arundel Medical Center, and another site to be named) will obtain IRB approval at their own institutions. Study Population: Patients are eligible if they are ≥18 years of age and meet the following criteria: 1. Positive COVID-19 PCR AND 2. Inpatient OR outpatient management of COVID-19 infection Patient Enrollment: We will create a search engine query through the EHR to identify patients with an objective COVID-19 diagnosis who are hospitalized or being treated as outpatients. This will be executed retrospectively for patients already objectively-diagnosed at participating clinical sites. Primary Outcome: 30-day and 90-day frequency of objectively confirmed, adjudicated arterial thromboembolism or VTE, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Secondary Outcome: 30-day and 90-day frequency of adjudicated all-cause death, bleeding, and thromboembolic outcomes. Additional Variables of Interest: Additional measured variables will include VTE-related risk factors, prevention and management patterns, and cause of death. We will review the notes and diagnostic testing sections of the Electronic Health Record to complete an electronic case report form for each subject.

More recently, some observational studies have shown a significant association between low vitamin D status and worse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients. Whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of adverse clinical outcomes in recently diagnosed COVID-19 patients and/or reduce risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2) in those likely to have been exposed to the virus (post-exposure prophylaxis) is unknown. The Vitamin D and COVID-19 Trial (VIVID) is a nationwide, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial in 2700 U.S. men and women investigating whether taking a daily dietary supplement of vitamin D3 for 4 weeks reduces the rate of seeking healthcare visits (including hospitalizations, emergency room visits, or ambulatory or virtual clinician visits) for symptoms or concerns related to COVID-19 or deaths in people newly diagnosed with COVID-19, and reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or disease severity in household contacts of individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19. The trial will enroll 1500 individuals aged 18 or older who are newly diagnosed with COVID-19 (""index cases"") and 1200 household contacts aged 18 or older. Following receipt of informed consent, participants will be randomized -- i.e., assigned by chance (like a coin toss) -- to one of two groups: (1) daily vitamin D3 (9600 IU/day on days 1-2; 3200 IU/day on days 3-28) or (2) daily vitamin D placebo. Index cases and household contacts of an index case (limited to at most one contact per household), if any, will be assigned to the same group (cluster randomization). Participants will take three oral softgel capsules on day 1, three capsules on day 2, and one capsule each day on days 3 through 28. Participants will receive a 4-week supply of study capsules via overnight courier service. Participants will fill out a short (15-20 minute) questionnaire each week during the 4-week pill-taking period, as well as a follow-up questionnaire at 8 weeks after randomization. These questionnaires ask about symptoms, general health, and use of medications and dietary supplements. Questionnaires will be completed online using a secure Internet-based system known as the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system. Participants must have an e-mail address to enroll in the study. Occasionally, participants (or their delegates) may receive a telephone call from study staff to collect information or to clarify answers on the questionnaire. Participants will be able to contact investigators or staff using a toll-free number, if they have any questions or need assistance. Participants (or their delegates) who indicate on a study questionnaire that they have been hospitalized will be sent a medical release form to be signed and returned. The release form will be used to get medical records from the participant's physician or hospital to confirm the specific reason for the hospitalization. In the event of a participant's death, the participant's delegate will be sent a medical release form to be signed and returned. The release form will be used to get medical records from the participant's physician or hospital to confirm the specific cause of death. Participants will provide dried blood spot samples at baseline and week 4. Participants will provide these samples using a sample collection kit mailed to their homes. Blood samples will be collected through a finger prick onto a filter paper. Blood samples will be stored and used to measure vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. In participants who are not diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study, blood samples will be also be tested for COVID-19 antibodies.

Severe pneumonia associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most threatening and feared complication of COVID-19 infection, with mortality rates close to 50% in some groups. Autopsies between these severe cases reveal severe capillary involvement, with signs of intense inflammatory changes, microvascular thrombosis, endothelial injury and abnormal tissue repair. The available evidence suggests that abnormal activation or imbalance in the counter-regulation of the kallikrein-kinin system may play a central role in a positive feedback cycle, leading to consequent diffuse microangiopathy. Blockade of the kallikrein-kinin system can therefore prevent deterioration of lung function by reducing inflammation, edema and microthrombosis.

3508,NCT04573322,Safety and Efficacy of Trans Sodium Crocetinate (TSC) in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Infected Subjects,,100-303,https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT04573322,Recruiting,,No,Yes,Industry,Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc,Diffusion Pharmaceuticals Inc[Industry],,Interventional,Phase 1|Phase 2,224.0,This study will assess the safety and efficacy of TSC as a treatment for participants who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).,"This trial has two phases. The first phase is an open-label, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, ascending dose, safety and tolerability lead-in. The second phase is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, adaptive, safety and efficacy, pilot. The lead-in phase will study 4 doses of TSC and enroll 24 participants. Each TSC dose will be administered as an IV bolus injection to 6 unique participants per dose level administered four times per day (every 6 hours) for 5 days. Participants will be assigned in groups of 3, and a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) after each group of 3 participants. The first group of 3 participants will receive TSC at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg. If there are no DLTs, 3 additional subjects will be studied at 0.25 mg/kg. If there are 0 or 1 DLT among the 6 participants studied at 0.25mg/kg, 3 additional participants will be studied at the next higher dose, 0.5 mg/kg. If there are no DLTs an additional 3 participants will be studied at 0.5 mg/kg. If there are 0 or 1 DLTs among the 6 subjects studied at 0.5 mg/kg, 3 additional participants will be studied at the next higher dose, 1.0 mg/kg. The study will continue in this fashion seeking an observed toxicity rate that is < 0.33 among 6 participants at any one dose level, or TSC at 1.5 mg/kg proves to be safe and tolerable. As participants complete the initial 5 days of treatment they will continue at their assigned TSC dose four times per day (every 6 hours) for up to 15 days. Participants will be assigned to dose levels in ascending order. The dose range is as follows. - 0.25 mg/kg TSC + Standard of Care - 0.50 mg/kg TSC + Standard of Care - 1.00 mg/kg TSC + Standard of Care - 1.50 mg/kg TSC + Standard of Care At the completion of the lead-in the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will examine the resultant safety and blood oxygenation (S:F) data for all participants and determine the optimum, safe and tolerable dose of TSC for use in the pilot study. Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is defined as any study drug related grade 3 or 4 adverse event during the treatment period, with the exception of pulmonary events in the CTCAE that are known complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Cough, Dyspnea, Hypoxia, Pneumonitis, Pulmonary Edema, Respiratory Failure, or Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders - Other. The SMC will apply clinical judgement in their review of adverse events (particularly abnormal laboratory results). The two arm, randomized pilot will enroll up to 200 participants, and will be overseen by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). TSC dosing will be at the selected optimum, safe and tolerable biologic dose with an active to placebo ratio of 2:1 toward providing the maximum potential benefit to participants. If two doses of TSC are to be studied in the randomized pilot the active to placebo ratio will be 2:2:1. Randomization will be stratified by disease severity, age and presence of pre-specified comorbidities. The treatment arms are as follows. - TSC + Standard of Care - Placebo + Standard of Care Each TSC dose will be administered as an IV bolus injection 4 times per day (every 6 hours) for up to 15 days. Participants randomized to placebo will receive an IV bolus injection of an equivalent volume by participant weight of Normal Saline four times per day (every 6 hours) for up to 15 days. All study drug administration will be performed by unblinded medical staff. Participants, investigators and caregivers will not see the injection or injection site or be aware of randomization. Blood oxygenation will be measured via recorded continuous pulse oximetry and the SpO2:Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) ratio calculated. All participants will undergo safety and efficacy assessments including laboratory assays, blood sampling on days 1 through day 15 (while hospitalized) and day 29 by return clinic visit or if still hospitalized.

The primary outcome is the proportion of hospitalised patients progressing from mild or moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients are treated for 14 days and will receive follow-up assessment at 7, 14 and 28 days after the first study dose. Patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 pneumonia will be recruited. Initially, n=171 (57 per arm) patients will be recruited in Stage 1. Following interim analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of the treatments, approximately n=285 (95 per arm) will be recruited during Stage 2.","COVID-19 pneumonia is characterised by respiratory and multi-organ failure in the context of marked systemic inflammation. It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2) infection. The hallmark of severe disease is hypoxia and a radiological pattern of acute lung injury that shares features with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Early features of COVID-19 result from host viral response and typically include symptoms such as fever and dry cough. Later features, typically occurring beyond 7 days, are characterised by marked and progressive systemic inflammation, identified by elevations in a plethora of inflammatory molecules such as C-reactive protein, ferritin and IL6. In a subset of patients, hyperinflammatory responses drive acute lung injury and may result in catastrophic multi-organ failure and death. The aetiology of COVID-19 induced ARDS is incompletely understood but appears to be associated with lung inflammation effected by a monocytic and neutrophilic infiltration, elevated cytokine levels and tissue damage. Elevations in circulating inflammatory molecules are associated with poor prognosis. In particular, the COVID-19 hyperinflammatory response syndrome is associated thrombotic complications which are postulated to drive cardiac dysfunction and microvascular thrombi, suggested by elevations in troponin and D-dimer, respectively. Similar hyperinflammatory responses are also seen in macrophage activation syndromes such as haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or in the cytokine release syndrome associated with chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy. Further, preliminary data from China and Italy have shown immediate resolution of symptoms using anti-interleukin-6 agents (anti-IL6) therapy and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) inhibitors in patients with severe disease. There may be an early window of opportunity to treat the COVID-19 hyperinflammatory syndrome before acute lung injury leads to organ failure. There are currently no approved treatments for COVID-19 pneumonia. This is a protocol for a randomised controlled, multi-arm trial of early intervention with inflammatory signal inhibitors. Study purpose A number of therapeutic interventions targeting inflammatory signalling might reduce the severity of the inflammatory response phase resulting in amelioration of the lung damage thereby averting respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of two inhibitors of key signalling pathways using drugs which are already licensed for use in other clinical indications. Primary objective The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of RUX and FOS to reduce the proportion of hospitalised patients progressing from mild/moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A modified World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Severity Ordinal Scale (COVID-19 Therapeutic Trial Synopsis published 18th February 2020) will be used to grade clinical deterioration from Hospitalised Mild Disease (<5) to Hospitalised Severe Disease (greater than or equal to 5). The modification includes an additional grade for Hospitalised Severe Disease that allows the capture of clinical deterioration in patients for whom escalation in organ support is not offered. Patients are eligible for recruitment to MATIS at grades 3 or 4. These patients stand to gain the greatest benefit from inflammatory signal inhibitors that may ameliorate the cytokine storm and prevent organ failure. Secondary objectives - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce mortality - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the need for invasive ventilation and/or ECMO - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the need for non-invasive ventilation including CPAP or high flow nasal oxygen - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the proportion of patients suffering clinically significant oxygen desaturation - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce the need for renal replacement therapy - Determine the efficacy of RUX and FOS to improve the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia on a modified WHO COVID-19 Ordinal Scale - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce blood ferritin, c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and D-dimer - Determine the efficacy of RUX or FOS to reduce duration of hospital admission - Evaluate the safety of RUX and FOS for COVID-19 pneumonia",Covid19|Pneumonia|Coronavirus,ruxolitinib|pneumonia|covid19|coronavirus|fostamatinib,Drug: Ruxolitinib|Drug: Fostamatinib|Other: Standard of care,"Drug:Ruxolitinib:Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)/Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor approved for clinical use in the treatment of splenomegaly, myelofibrosis, polycythaemia vera and graft-versus-host disease.

A vaccine causes the body to have an immune response that may help prevent the infection or reduce the severity of symptoms. An adjuvant is something that can make a vaccine work better. This study will look at the protective effect, body's immune response, and safety of SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant in the study population. Participants in the study will randomly be assigned to receive SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant or placebo. Each participant in the study will receive a total of 2 intramuscular injections of either ARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M1 adjuvant or placebo in Initial Vaccination Period. Up to 30,000 participants will take part in the study. Following authorization for Emergency Use in the US based on demonstration of statistically significant vaccine efficacy and satisfactory safety in an analysis of the primary endpoint sufficient to support application for EUA, participants will be scheduled for administration of 2 injections of the alternate study material 21 days apart (""blinded crossover"").

Unlike the majority of coronaviruses that cause mild disease in humans and animals, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in the lower respiratory tract to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and fatal pneumonia. Effective interventions to prevent or treat COVID-19 remain limited in number and clinical experience is limited. Clinical management is limited to supportive care, consequently overwhelming resources of healthcare systems around the world. As a response to the ongoing pandemic, AstraZeneca is developing mAbs to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains the virus's RBD, which enables the virus to bind to receptors on human cells. By targeting this region of the virus's spike protein, antibodies can block the virus's attachment to human cells, and, therefore, is expected to block infection. Amino acid substitutions have been introduced into the antibodies to both extend their half-lives, which should prolong their potential prophylactic benefit, and decrease Fc effector function in order to decrease the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. AZD7442, a combination of 2 of these mAbs (AZD8895 and AZD1061), is being evaluated for administration to prevent and/or treat COVID-19.

Unlike the majority of coronaviruses that cause mild disease in humans and animals, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in the lower respiratory tract to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and fatal pneumonia. Effective interventions to prevent or treat COVID-19 remain limited in number and clinical experience is limited. Clinical management is limited to supportive care, consequently overwhelming resources of healthcare systems around the world. As a response to the ongoing pandemic, AstraZeneca is developing mAbs to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains the virus's RBD, which enables the virus to bind to receptors on human cells. By targeting this region of the virus's spike protein, antibodies can block the virus's attachment to human cells, and, therefore, is expected to block infection. Amino acid substitutions have been introduced into the antibodies to both extend their half-lives, which should prolong their potential prophylactic benefit, and decrease Fc effector function in order to decrease the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. AZD7442, a combination of 2 of these mAbs (AZD8895 and AZD1061), is being evaluated for administration to prevent and/or treat COVID-19.

A total of 25,800 subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the BBV152 vaccine and control. All participants will be assessed for efficacy and safety endpoints and provide a Nasopharyngeal(NP) swab and blood sample before the first dose of IP. The NP swab and blood collected will be subject to RT-PCR and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. The results of this will not affect the enrollment of the participant. Participants who are found to be positive for either RT-PCR Or Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies will be excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. A safety follow-up will be done for all. In addition, sites will be segregated based on the study objectives: Category 1 (Symptomatic): In addition to administering the IP, a series of post-dose telephonic follow-up visits will be scheduled to detect suspect symptomatic COVID-19 infections. If a suspect is identified, a nasopharyngeal sample will be collected from the participant for detecting the presence of COVID-19 infection. Telephonic follow-up will occur at 15 Day intervals. Category 2 (Symptomatic/Asymptomatic): In addition to administering the IP, a series of post-dose Nasopharyngeal samples for detecting an incidence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection at 1-Month intervals will be collected. Category 3 (Symptomatic/Asymptomatic+Immunogenicity): In addition to administering the IP and collecting NP samples, a series of blood samples will be collected for analyzing serum for immunological assessments. The Phase 3 study will follow randomized study participants for efficacy until virologically confirmed (RT-PCR positive) symptomatic COVID-19 participants will be eligible for the primary efficacy analysis. After reaching the target number (n=130) of symptomatic COVID-19 cases, the study will continue to assess safety until the completion of the study duration.

Data generated through Day 56 (Month 2) will be unblinded only to the biostatistician for evaluation of immune responses in the Immunogenicity subset.

Since then, it has spread to almost 200 countries and infection rates are rapidly accelerating. Overactivation of T cells resulting in immune dysfunction, dysfunction of the renin angiotensin system, and antibody-dependent enhancement are thought to contribute to the cytokine storm that results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), culminating in death. In addition to causing respiratory symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 can cause diarrhea and has been isolated from the stool. SARS-CoV-2 binds to Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on lung alveolar type 2 cells, but ACE2 is also expressed in the absorptive enterocytes from the ileum and colon. The diarrhea may be caused by increased intestinal permeability due to binding of these receptors by the SARS-CoV-2. Thus, an intervention to attenuate this cytokine storm may improve clinical outcomes in people with COVID-19. One such intervention is oral administration of serum bovine immunoglobulins, which decreases interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels safely with minimal side effects. Animal and human clinical studies have shown dietary supplementation with oral immunoglobulins improves mucosal immunity, specifically respiratory/pulmonary and GI mucosa, and decreases systemic inflammation, reducing the symptoms and severity of pulmonary inflammation and viral infections. Hypothesis: Dietary supplementation with EnteraGam® will decrease IL-6 levels and prevent disease progression in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of the oral nutritional therapy EnteraGam® (serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate) to prevent disease progression of COVID-19 and to decrease IL-6 levels as compared to standard of care in subjects with COVID-19. Methods: Randomized open-label clinical study evaluating the effectiveness of EnteraGam® 10.0 g BID (every 12 hours) added to standard of care, as compared to standard of care alone, in subjects with COVID-19.","Subject population: Outpatient and inpatient male and non-pregnant females ≥18 years old, diagnosed with COVID-19 in the emergency department or admitted to the hospital but not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or in the ICU. Approximately 420 subjects will be randomized (2:1 ratio), 280 in the EnteraGam® arm and 140 in the control (standard of care) arm. Nutritional intervention: ImmunoLin is the active ingredient in EnteraGam®, a medical food developed and marketed by Entera Health in the US since 2013. ImmunoLin is an edible bovine plasma-derived immunoglobulin concentrate developed in 2001 as an immunoglobulin enriched plasma preparation for the human dietary supplement market. ImmunoLin is Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) following a letter of no objection from the US FDA in 2008. Physicians have prescribed EnteraGam® for patients with a variety of GI-related conditions. Statistical methodology: Efficacy: Based on per protocol analysis. Subjects lacking an assessment at Week 2 will be included in the analysis using the last available post-baseline data. Three pre-specified secondary analyses will be performed: 1) restricted to subjects with a comorbidity considered a major risk factor for hospitalization and disease severity (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, chronic renal disease, immunocompromised state); 2) restricted to age ≥ 50 years; 3) by inpatient only and outpatient only subgroups. Additional analysis of covariance models with adjustment for Baseline characteristics and interactions may be examined in supportive or exploratory analyses. Safety: All safety analyses will be based on all subjects who are randomized to EnteraGam and subsequently receive at least 1 packet of investigational product. Safety assessments will be analyzed by frequency of events/abnormalities for categorical values or summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, range, and number of observations).",Covid19,SARS-CoV-2|Coronavirus|Bovine Plasma-Derived Immunoglobulin,Dietary Supplement: Bovine Plasma-Derived Immunoglobulin Concentrate|Other: Standard of care,"Dietary Supplement:Bovine Plasma-Derived Immunoglobulin Concentrate:EnteraGam® 10.0 g, containing 5.0 g of serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin/protein isolate (SBI) BID (every 12 hours) for 2 weeks.|Other:Standard of care:Standard of care PSMAR protocol for COVID-19 patients.",Experimental:EnteraGam + standard of care:Subjects will receive EnteraGam® (oral nutritional therapy) + standard of care for COVID-19 for 2 weeks.

Specific Aims: 1. Determine the efficacy of splenic ultrasound in affecting markers of systemic inflammation in COVID-19 infection. 2. Evaluate the potential efficacy of splenic ultrasound in affecting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 infection.,"Ultrasound is widely used in human medicine because it is safe, non-invasive, and painless. The same kind of ultrasound that is used for imaging (for example, to visualize babies in utero) may be able to treat inflammatory diseases including COVID-19. COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some COVID-19 patients develop a severe respiratory disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome and this disease is caused, in part, by a significant increase in inflammatory factors. Clinical therapies that reduce this elevated inflammation in the body (e.g., inflammation molecules in your body called cytokines) may be capable of diminishing symptoms in severe cases of COVID-19. Multiple studies in animals with hyper-inflammation conditions (e.g., inflammatory arthritis and sepsis/LPS injections) and recent human studies (e.g., for the treatment of joint inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis) have shown that ultrasound applied to the spleen can suppress blood/genetic markers of inflammation. Similar inflammatory markers, or cytokines, are elevated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and believed to cause severe symptoms. Splenic ultrasound can potentially lower these inflammatory cytokines without hindering antibody production, leading to clinical improvements in COVID-19 patients. This study will employ ultrasound devices produced by General Electric (GE LOGIQ E10 device with C1-6 ultrasound probe) that are currently used in hospitals and approved for diagnostic imaging by the FDA. The ultrasound energies applied to the spleen in this study in COVID-19 patients will not exceed what is currently approved for diagnostic imaging with those GE ultrasound devices. There will be two groups in this study with 15 participants in each group. One group will receive ultrasound application to the spleen, in addition to the standard clinical care. A control group will receive standard clinical care without splenic ultrasound. Each ultrasound application session will last about 15-20 minutes per day for 7 days, unless the participant is discharged sooner. For ultrasound stimulation, a small gel-coated probe is positioned on the upper left abdomen area over the ribs. The ultrasound session includes a period of 5-10 minutes when study personnel use the ultrasound device to locate the spleen and to position the ultrasound probe in a proper location around the ribs area, and an approximately 10-minute period for application of ultrasound to the spleen. Collection of clinical outcome data and daily blood draws will be performed in each participant throughout the study. Additional data collected from each participant during their routine clinical care beyond their study involvement will also be analyzed together with the study data to evaluate the specific aims of the clinical trial.",Inflammation|Cytokine Storm|Covid19,immunomodulation|spleen|ultrasound stimulation|ultrasound|neuromodulation,Device: Splenic ultrasound,Device:Splenic ultrasound:GE LOGIQ E10 device with C1-6 ultrasound probe,"Experimental:Ultrasound Group:Daily ultrasound application to the spleen of approximately 10 minutes for up to 7 days, in addition to standard clinical care.|No Intervention:Control Group:Standard clinical care with no ultrasound stimulation.",Experimental[Ultrasound Group]:Device[Splenic ultrasound],Between-arm change of IL-6 levels from baseline to end of treatment between groups|Between-arm change of IL-1β levels from baseline to end of treatment between groups|Between-arm change of CRP levels from baseline to end of treatment between groups|Change in time to recovery|Change in death rate|Change in rate of requiring mechanical ventilation|Change in duration of hypoxemia|Change in D-dimer levels|Change in serum cytokine concentration of TNF|Change in serum cytokine concentration of IL-10|Change in serum cytokine concentration of IFN-gamma|Change in serum cytokine concentration of IL-18|Change in serum cytokine concentration of IL2R-alpha|Change in serum cytokine concentration of IL-4|Change in RNAseq identified pro-inflammatory pathways,2021-01-14,2021-04-30,2021-06-30,2021-01-08,,2021-03-09,"ClinicalTrials.gov processed this data on March 09, 2021",2021-01-05,No,No,Yes,No,"M Health Fairview St. Joseph's Hospital, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States",1,Yes,Yes,Allocation: Randomized|Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment|Primary Purpose: Other|Masked: None (Open Label),2.0,,Other,Parallel Assignment,,Randomized,None (Open Label),No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,18 Years,,All,,,No,,"Inclusion Criteria: - Age 18 and above - Positive for SARS-CoV-2 (via PCR) - Decreased blood oxygen saturation: Room air SaO2 < 94% and/or requiring supplemental oxygen to maintain SaO2 > 90% - Admission to the hospital Exclusion Criteria: - Pregnant women - Asplenia - Ascites - Open wound/sores near the stimulation site - Recent abdominal surgery - Splenomegaly - Mechanically ventilated (if patient goes onto mechanical ventilation while participating in the study, they can continue ultrasound treatment if recommended by standard of care clinician and investigators of the study) - Comfort care status - Any other clinical reasons deemed by the investigators of the study in which the patient would not be an appropriate candidate for the study",No,,General Electric Research,GE

Study population are adult KTRs with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild to moderate symptoms. At study entry, subjects are on standard therapy of dual immunosuppressive treatment of prednisone and tacrolimus (TAC), following randomization, 10 out of 20 subjects will remain on this therapy for the duration of the study, while the other 10 subjects will switch to VCS.","Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) are general immunosuppressive agents commonly used in the setting of transplantation to prevent solid organ rejection. CNIs form the cornerstone of immunosuppressive treatment in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) including the 1st generation CNI Cyclosporin-A (CsA) and the most commonly employed 2nd generation CNI tacrolimus (TAC). It is of interest that CNIs, especially CsA, also exert anti-viral effects in addition to immunosuppressive effects. Common side effects of CNIs are hypertension, new-onset diabetes, renal insufficiency and neurotoxicity. Therefore, in the recent decennium, efforts have been directed at developing a novel CNI, voclosporin (VCS), that has improved pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) attributes with respect to calcineurin inhibition as well as an improved safety profile to common side effects. VCS has been extensively studied in KTRs demonstrating equivalent efficacy to TAC with respect to prevention of rejection while showing a reduction in CNI-related toxicity. Most recently, VCS as a component of multitargeted therapy demonstrated superior efficacy compared to standard of care in lupus nephritis (LN) patients. In 2011, a pivotal study from Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) demonstrated in vitro anti-viral effect of CsA on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1). Subsequently, VCS has been shown to have a more potent anti-viral effect on norovirus compared to CsA. The anti-viral effects of CNIs have a different mechanism of inhibition in each virus but mainly through inhibiting cyclophilins, an essential protein for viral replication. The SARS-CoV-1 interacts with human cyclophilins, however the role of these proteins in infection remains elusive. Different reports stablished interactions between nsp1 or nucleocapsid proteins with Cyps and hypothesize its influence in viral replication and viral entry. Unlike VCS and CsA, TAC binds to FK binding proteins rather than cyclophilin A (CypA). Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, the LUMC has very recently demonstrated anti-viral effects of CNIs on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in vitro: a 2-log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral titers in Calu-3 2B4 bronchial cell cultures was observed when incubated with ~3 μM VCS compared to 25μM CsA and 25μM TAC. In each experiment Remdesivir was taken as positive control as it inhibits viral replication by >4log at 10 μM concentration. As such, VCS becomes an attractive and potentially feasible CNI to use or switch to in COVID-19 infected KTRs who are already using CNIs as part of their chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Because subjects will be randomized to either VCS or TAC as immunosuppressive agent during COVID-19 infection, the burden of the study is two-fold: first, subjects will need to switch to a novel CNI which intrinsically will harbour an uncertainty. However, from a clinical point-of-view VCS is proven equivalent to TAC with respect to organ rejection and safety monitoring of adequate drug levels is incorporated in the study. Secondly, subjects will need to agree to self-assessments including monitoring of vital signs and collection of saliva samples and a throat swab in the first 56 days. We believe that it is actually in the interest of subjects to undergo this intensive monitoring because current standard practice is for KTRs with mild symptoms to not be hospitalized and stay at home until recovery without further monitoring. In addition, blood sampling (10 x 38.5 mL), urine sampling and additional hospital visits will take place which are outside of normal clinical practice. The potential advantage of the study to KTRs is that VCS may lead to a quicker reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load and quicker relief of symptoms. Altogether, we believe the burden of the study is minimal and outweighed by the potential benefit of the treatment on COVID-19 infection.",Covid19|Kidney Transplant Infection,,Drug: Voclosporin|Drug: Tacrolimus,Drug:Voclosporin:Temporarily switching of tacrolimus maintenance immunosuppression to voclosporin maintenance immunosuppression with possible additional anti-viral activity|Drug:Tacrolimus:Comparator,"Experimental:Voclosporin (VCS):Prior to or at study entry, subjects are reduced in their standard immunosuppressive therapy to dual therapy with prednisone and tacrolimus according to current local guidelines.

Sargramostim (Leukine) is a formulation of Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF), which is a critical cytokine for healthy pulmonary function. Detailed studies have shown that GM-CSF is necessary for alveolar macrophage (AM) maturation and maintenance. Although GM-CSF was discovered as a myelopoietic growth factor, it has diverse additional effects that both promote differentiation of myeloid precursors into neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells and control function of mature myeloid cells. GM-CSF is also known to reverse immunoparalysis seen in sepsis, resulting in beneficial outcomes. In addition, GM-CSF prevents bacteremia in post influenza bacterial pneumonia through locally mediated improved lung antibacterial resistance and increased reactive oxygen species production by AMs. Pulmonary delivery of this GM-CSF has potential to reduce morbidity and mortality due to viral pneumonias, potentially including COVID-19.",SARS-CoV Infection|Covid19,SCOPE|(recombinant human) GM-CSF|immune modulator|Leukine|sargramostim|SARS-CoV2|COVID-19,Drug: Placebo|Drug: Sargramostim,Drug:Placebo:All patients in the control arm will receive an equivalent volume of inhaled placebo diluent administered via a vibrating mesh nebulizer once daily for 5 days.|Drug:Sargramostim:All patients randomized to the sargramostim treatment arm will be treated with 250 mcg inhaled sargramostim administered via a vibrating mesh nebulizer once daily for 5 days.,Placebo Comparator:Placebo Arm:Day 1 - 5: Placebo treatment in addition to standard of care for COVID-19|Experimental:Sargramostim Arm:Day 1 - 5: Sargramostim treatment in addition to standard of care for COVID-19,Placebo Comparator[Placebo Arm]:Drug[Placebo]|Experimental[Sargramostim Arm]:Drug[Sargramostim],"Adverse Events|Change from Baseline in Symptom Scores|Time to Disease Progression based on NIAID Score|Disease Progression based on NIAID Score|COVID-19-related emergency room visit or COVID-19- related hospitalization, or death (any cause)",2021-04-30,2021-06-30,2021-06-30,2021-01-13,,2021-04-06,"ClinicalTrials.gov processed this data on April 06, 2021",2021-01-11,No,Yes,No,No,"West Valley Research Clinic, LLC, Phoenix, Arizona, United States",1,Yes,Yes,"Allocation: Randomized|Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment|Primary Purpose: Treatment|Masked: Double (Participant, Investigator)",2.0,,Treatment,Parallel Assignment,,Randomized,Double,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,18 Years,,All,,,No,,"Inclusion Criteria: 1.

The main aims of the study are to learn if TAK-019 can protect people from Covid-19 and to check for side effects from TAK-019. At the first visit, the study doctor will check if each person can take part. Those who can take part will be chosen for 1 of 2 treatments by chance. Participants will either receive an injection of TAK-019 or a placebo in their arm. In this study, a placebo will look like the TAK-019 vaccine but will not have any medicine in it. 3 times as many participants will receive TAK-019 than placebo. Participants will receive 2 injections of TAK-019 or placebo, 21 days apart. Participants will be asked to record their temperature and any medical problems in an electronic diary for up to 7 days after each injection. During the study, participants will visit the clinic for regular check-ups, blood tests, and sometimes for nose swab samples. When all participants have attended a clinic visit 28 days after their 2nd injection, the study sponsor (Takeda) will check how many participants have made enough antibodies to protect them against Covid-19. The participants will stay in the study for up to 12 months after they have had their 2nd injection. During this time, the study doctors will continue to check how many participants have made enough antibodies to protect them against Covid-19. Also, they will check if participants have any more side effects from TAK-019 or the placebo.","The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-019. TAK-019 is being tested to prevent infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

As of 6 October 2020, the virus has spread to all corners of the globe, with over 35 million confirmed cases reported and more than one million associated deaths according to the WHO. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing major disruption to global healthcare systems with significant socioeconomic impacts. Effective interventions to prevent or treat COVID-19 remain few in number and clinical experience is limited. There is an urgent need to rapidly evaluate treatments in the non-hospitalized setting to prevent progression and reduce serious complications of COVID-19, as well as its transmission. As a response to the ongoing pandemic, AstraZeneca is developing mAbs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains the virus's RBD, which enables the virus to bind to receptors on human cells. By targeting this region of the virus's spike protein, antibodies can block the virus's attachment to human cells, and, therefore, is expected to block infection. Amino acid substitutions have been introduced into the antibodies to both extend their half-lives, which should prolong their potential prophylactic benefit, and decrease Fc effector function in order to decrease the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. AZD7442, a combination of 2 of these mAbs (AZD8895 and AZD1061), is being evaluated for administration to treat or prevent COVID-19. There are currently one ongoing Phase I study and two ongoing Phase III studies with AZD7442, in addition to this treatment study.

This has been shown to increase mortality and morbidity among athletes. Several efforts have been made to guide sports participation after COVID-19, but not much scientific evidence is present to back-up those guidelines. The current initiative aims gain a heightened insight in this matter.To identify the presence of fibrosis athletes who recovered from COVID-19 will undergo CMR (Cardiac MRI). All athletes will also undergo echocardiography, 5-day Holtermonitoring among others. This will allow to determine whether differences between those with and those without fibrosis are present. If fibrosis is present, athletes will be offered an implantation of a very small monitoring device that will be able to detect arrhythmias with a much higher sensitivity. Also an exercise echocardiography will be performed, to determine the safety of continuation of athletic efforts.","Baseline investigations will depend on the clinical presentation of the athlete. Three groups are identified: 1. Asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic: anosmia, ageusia, headache, mild fatigue, fever ≤3d, myalgias ≤3d , mild upper respiratory tract illness, and mild gastrointestinal illness 2. Moderate to severe symptoms: at least 2 of: persistent fever ≥4d, chills ≥4d, myalgias ≥4d, lethargy impairing activities of daily life (ADL) ≥4d, dyspnea during ADL ≥4d, and chest tightness ≥4d. Or cardiac symptoms: dyspnea, exercise intolerance, chest tightness, dizziness, (pre)syncope, and (new onset) palpitations. 3. Hospitalized: all athletes admitted for COVID-19, whether or not on the intensive care unit. - Group 1 will undergo a thorough history, clinical examination, ECG, laboratory tests for hs-Troponin T (TnT) and hsCRP, echocardiography at rest, 5-day-Holter and CMR. These examinations will take place at least 30 days after the first symptoms or positive test. Follow-up will be performed as pointed out with the grey crosses in the table. Depending on the results further investigation may be required (as in group 2 and 3). This part of the study is interventional in nature (not according to standard of care in those individuals). - Groups 2 and 3 will undergo a more extensive evaluation: a thorough history, clinical examination, ECG, laboratory tests for hs-TnT and hsCRP, echocardiography at rest, CardioPulmonary Exercise Test (CPET), 5-day-Holter, late potentials and CMR. If in any athlete the CMR shows signs of fibrosis or myocarditis, an exercise echocardiography will be performed additionally.

Secondarily, data will further characterize self-reported voice and symptom profiles for acute respiratory illnesses in participants; this would benefit vaccine development across several key disease areas, including RSV and influenza virus, beyond the immediate application to SARS-CoV-2. The study also models concepts of more efficient ""flexible"" clinical trials involving not only voice recognition, but also web-based participant recruitment, enhanced participant engagement, and remote sample collection that could make future clinical studies more efficient. The clinical data obtained in this observational study could provide the documentation of the technology's performance needed to enable its deployment in future interventional studies.","Each subject will be required to stay in the study for 6 weeks. If the participant tests positive for any of the three viruses at swab #1 or swab #2, they will continue the study until the end of Week 8. Participants will record acute respiratory illnesses and SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and voice data daily for up to a maximum of 8 weeks in both the well state and, should they become ill, the sick state, utilizing the Electronic diary on their Mobile application. Once enrolled, the participant will start recording symptoms and voice in the Electronic diary, with daily time commitment to this portion of the study expected to be 2-4 minutes. Two nasal self-swab collection kits will be ordered for delivery to the participant once they are enrolled in the study. The participant will be asked to self-swab when the test kit arrives (swab #1). The kit, including the specimen, will be returned to the central lab for RT-PCR SARS-CoV2/Influenza/RSV RT-PCR testing. The participant is expected to complete 3 phonemes and 5 lines of reading each day, in addition to score the self-reported symptoms in the Electronic diary. If participants become sick (self-report) with new or increased symptoms of respiratory illness including SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, they will be asked to self-swab (swab #2) and return the sample for central SARS-CoV-2/Influenza/RSV RT-PCR testing. If the participant does not develop any new or increased symptoms between swab #1 and end of Week 6, they will obtain a self-swab (swab #2) at Day 42. If the participant tests positive for any of the three viruses at swab #1 or swab #2, they will continue the study until end of week 8.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in adult participants in the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy. Ad26.COV2.S (also known as Ad26COVS1) is a monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector, constructed to encode the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein. For adult participants, the total study duration from screening until the last follow-up visit will be approximately 16 months (depending on the gestational age at enrollment and if the second dose of vaccine will need to be administered post-partum). The study will consist of a screening phase (28 days), vaccination phase (3 months) and a follow up phase (up to 12 months post-partum [PP]). For neonates/infants (born to adult participants who received vaccination) the total study duration from birth until the last follow-up visit will be approximately 12 months.

VBI-2902a with up to 10μg spike (S) protein content and aluminum phosphate adjuvant is delivered by intramuscular (IM) injection. The Phase 1 / 2 study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of VBI-2902a at one- and two-dose regimens and two dose levels (5 μg and 10 μg of S protein) as compared to placebo (saline solution) in healthy adults 18 years of age and above.","Phase 1: The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VBI-2902a containing 5 μg of S protein in one- or two-dose regimens in healthy adults of 18-54 years of age. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of VBI-2902a containing 5 μg of S protein in one- or two-dose regimens in healthy adults 18-54 years of age. - Group G1 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 5 μg of S protein at Day 1 and placebo at Day 28. - Group G2 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 5 μg of S protein at Days 1 and 28. - Group G3 - 20 participants will receive placebo at Days 1 and 28. An Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data through Study Day 7, 35 and 56. Enrollment in the Phase 2 will commence once the DSMB confirms that safety data through Study Day 56 is acceptable and that stopping rules were not met. Phase 2: The two co-primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of one- and two-dose regimens at two dose levels (5 μg and 10 μg of S protein) of VBI-2902a as compared to placebo in healthy adults stratified by age group (18-54, 55-65 and >65 years). The optimal dose level and regimen will be selected based on the safety and immunogenicity data from Phase 1 and Phase 2, Part 2.1 of the study. Phase 2, Part 2.1 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a one-dose or two-dose regimen of VBI-2902a at the high dose level (10 μg of S protein) in healthy adults aged 18 to 54 years and at low and high dose levels (5 and 10 μg of S protein) in healthy adults age 55 to 65 years. Enrollment will be initiated in a staggered fashion with DSMB confirmation that safety is acceptable and that stopping rules were not met before the participants in the higher dose and higher age groups start enrollment. The lower age cohort will include 60 healthy adults 18 to 54 years randomized at a 2:1 ratio to VBI-2902a or placebo: - Group G4 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 10 μg of S protein at Day 1 and placebo at Day 28 - Group G5 - 20 participants will receive VBI-2902a at a dose of 10 μg of S protein at Days 1 and 28. - Group G6 - 20 participants will receive placebo at Days 1 and 28.

Recently, the SARS-Cov2 virus spread in an epidemic that began in China and soon spread globally, making its study extremely relevant, in order to seek mechanisms to combat it. Therefore, this study seeks to evaluate the benefit of using Hydroxychloroquine with or without Apixaban in the early treatment of patients with suspected COVID-19. Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study, performed at Hospital das Clínicas Samuel Libânio (Universidade do Vale do Sapucaí) UNIVÁS, Pouso Alegre, Minas Gerais, Brasil. Patients treated in the emergency department who are reported as suspected cases of COVID-19 patients will be included, according to current guidelines. Will be randomized into 4 groups: Hydroxychloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine + Apixabana, only Apixabana and Control group, all receiving standard treatment recommended. Included patients will be monitored during hospitalization or remotely assisted in home treatment. Clinical, laboratory, electrocardiographic and image evaluation criteria will be considered to assess the evolution in 7 and 14 days after inclusion. Results will be subjected to appropriate statistical analysis, with sample calculation. An early therapeutic approach is proposed in suspected and confirmed patients with COVID-19, with the hope of reducing hospitalizations and severe forms of the disease.","The early administration of HCQ or in association with apixaban, could prevent worsening of suspected COVID-19, as well as preventing hospitalizations and the need for intensive treatment. In patients with mild to moderate disease, the use of hydroxychloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with apixaban or apixaban alone, could be able to reduce disease progression on an ordinal scale of outcome (including use of mechanical ventilation and death) and decrease the likelihood of hospitalization or worsening of clinical conditions.",Complication,Anticoagulants|Chloroquine|SARS-CoV-2|Novel coronavirus 2019|Complications,Drug: Control group (standard hospital treatment)|Drug: Group Hydroxychloroquine|Drug: Group Hydroxychloroquine and apixaban|Drug: Group Apixaban,"Drug:Control group (standard hospital treatment):Medications defined by the hospital involved in the study|Drug:Group Hydroxychloroquine:Patients in this group will receive hydroxychloroquine orally 200 mg every 12 hours for 7 days.

5061,NCT04801134,Interventions to Manage Food Insecurity and Inappropriate Feeding Practices Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic,AMISTAD,HRP-UT901,https://ClinicalTrials.gov/show/NCT04801134,Not yet recruiting,,No,No,Industry|Other,Perrigo Company|University of Texas at Austin,University of Texas at Austin[Other],Perrigo Company[Industry],Interventional,N|A,50.0,"This is a pilot study to determine how to identify and characterize effective approaches to assist Hispanic families who face food insecurity worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. The investigators will enroll 50 children with food insecurity who are patients of the largest Federally Qualified Health Center in Austin, Texas. The investigators will follow them for 6 months, providing their caretakers with community resources, food literacy education and assisting them with web sites and applications that they can use to learn about and contact community assistance programs. The investigators will review food insecurity screening, qualitative interviews, dietary assessments, the child's anthropometrics, and standard of care laboratory results. The investigators will schedule follow up phone visits throughout the study to discuss with the families their needs and perceived assistance from the resources provided.","The investigators propose to assess food insecurity and inappropriate feeding practices within a public health clinic patient population that has at least one child less than 2 years of age at home. A targeted intervention will determine whether focused family interactions with referral and follow-up to community agencies can mitigate the frequency and effects of food insecurity on children over a six-month period. Specifically, the investigators will identify 50 Hispanic families with food insecurity based on a full screen (the investigators expect to screen 150 families). There are 2 in-person visits for this study, both of which are routine clinic visits where the child would be seen regardless of participation in this research study. The first visit at baseline will be when the subject is approached about the study and enrolled. The second visit will also be at a routine pediatric visit for medical care follow-up approximately 6 months later. Between in-person visits, phone calls for follow-up will take place. The investigators will use a highly validated U.S. Department of Agriculture six-question, five-minute screening tool at each pediatric visit, via telehealth or in person. Those who screen as positive for food insecurity and consent to participate will be enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled as a parent/child dyad. The validated food-insecurity questionnaire will be completed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends to screen for food insecurity as a standard of care. Resources When appropriate, specific referrals will be made by the study personnel (PIs who are pediatricians) to food assistance programs including Good Apple, a local fresh produce delivery program, United Way of Central Texas, and local food banks. The participants will receive a call from the study coordinator who will review the family circumstances and plan for intervention with these partner programs and follow-up. A research team member will contact our food assistance partners to confirm each family's participation. The investigators will also confirm participation when available in WIC and SNAP programs. Partner organizations will provide financial data regarding the interventions they provide, which will be analyzed and interpreted within the context of families' participation in public programs such as WIC and SNAP. The study coordinator or designee who are part of the research study team will call the families frequently (weekly for first month, then every 2 weeks until 3 months, then monthly from 3-6 months; about 12-15 calls total) to check on their progress with the food assistance programs. The participants will receive assistance with finding useful community resources websites and/or applications, grocery shopping lists, tips for shopping on a budget, and more topics related to nutrition, wellness, food assistance programs, food banks, bus routes, mindfulness, meal planning, and parenting strategies. Along with the referral resources, these documents and apps (i.e., My Fitness Pal food tracker, Pacer fitness tracker) will help the participants improve food literacy. Providing resources when a family is identified as food insecure is standard of care. However, the electronic resources and ongoing follow up are only related to this study. The investigators will track if the participants access the electronic resources that the investigators provide. Education and Food Literacy Families will receive education about appropriate feeding practices with emphasis on not over-diluting infant formula and appropriate introduction of cow's milk, juice and solid foods. Education for improving food literacy will focus on the following four dimensions from budgeting and planning, to food selection, to preparation and cooking, to eating. Dietary Assessment Due to the relationship between dietary intake and overall health, dietary assessment tools are helpful to evaluate what a person is eating and how it may have an impact, either positive or negative, on their health. The participant will be asked to provide a 24-hour nutrition intake recall (describing types and amounts of foods and drinks they consumed the previous day) for themselves and their child. The study dietitian or designee will analyze the food records with nutrition software (i.e., NDSR) for macronutrient and macronutrient breakdown. Dietary intake will be assessed at baseline and after six months using a validated questionnaire. This information will be helpful to see how dietary intakes potentially change after enrollment and participation in community resources, and to see how dietary intakes affect growth in children. Growth and Labs The investigators will compare growth measurements (weight, height or length, and head circumference) and dietary intakes of participating children at the start and after six months. In addition, the investigators will abstract data from the child's medical record for nutrition-related and routinely ordered labs (i.e., hemoglobin, lead level). These anthropometrics and laboratories are obtained as standard of care. Hemoglobin and lead levels usually are obtained at 1 and 2 years of age. Children screening out as iron deficient or with elevated lead levels will be managed by their pediatrician according to current American Academy of Pediatrics and Texas Department of Public Health guidelines. Qualitative Interviews Qualitative interviews will be conducted in person or by phone at baseline and after three and six months to evaluate issues of concern such as child care, transportation and loss of employment. Qualitative interviews, pertaining to this study, will include asking participants which resources they found to be most useful, ease of navigating the resources, and their overall interactions with the partner organizations. All subjects will participate in the main (shorter) qualitative interview. Fifteen (15) subjects will be asked to participate in a longer qualitative interview, that the investigators expect to take an additional 30-60 minutes. These subjects will receive additional compensation for their time. Standard of Care • Food insecurity screening, provision of referrals and resources to family, anthropometrics, labs, education Research Activities • Qualitative interviews, depression screen PHQ), anxiety screen (GAD), dietary assessment, follow-up with family to discuss their participation with referrals and resources Our objectives are: 1. To identify and characterize Hispanic families who face food insecurity that occurred or worsened as a result of the current pandemic 2. To identify and characterize effective approaches to assisting families with inappropriate feeding practices, especially those related to infant formula preparation 3. To gain information regarding the types of resources that are most useful for planning purposes related to future pandemics or related public health crises 4.

Dependent upon safety and/or immunogenicity data generated during the course of this study, and the resulting assessment of benefit-risk, the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in participants <6 months of age may subsequently be evaluated.","Phase 1 is the open-label dose-finding portion of the study to evaluate safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 on a 2-dose (separated by approximately 21 days) schedule in up to 3 age groups (participants ≥5 to <12 years, ≥2 to <5 years, and ≥6 months to <2 years of age). Dose finding is being initiated in this study in participants ≥5 to <12 years of age based on the acceptable blinded safety assessment of the 30-μg dose in 12- to 15-year-olds in the C4591001 study. The purpose of Phase 1 is to identify preferred dose level(s) of BNT162b2 from up to 3 different dose levels in each age group. Phase 2/3 will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in each age group at the selected dose level from Phase 1. Efficacy will be evaluated across all age groups in which immunobridging is successful, depending on accrual of a sufficient number of cases across those age groups. All participants will have blood drawn at baseline prior to Dose 1 and 6 months after Dose 2. Immunobridging to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the C4591001 study will be based on immunogenicity data collected at baseline and 1 month after Dose 2. The persistence of the immune response will be based on immunogenicity data collected in participants at baseline and at 1, 6, 12 (original BNT162b2 group only), and 24 months after Dose 2 (original BNT162b2 group only). In addition, efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 and against asymptomatic infection will also be assessed. At the 6-month follow-up visit, all participants will be unblinded. Participants who originally received placebo will be offered the opportunity to receive BNT162b2 as part of the study. Approximately 450 participants (300 in the active vaccine group and 150 in the placebo group) randomized in each age group in this phase will contribute to the immunobridging analysis at 1 month after Dose 2 and will contribute to the overall analysis of the persistence of immune response at 6 months after Dose 2. These participants will be enrolled from both US and EU sites to ensure this subset is representative of the whole study. For the persistence time points of 12 and 24 months after Dose 2, approximately 70 participants from each age group in the original BNT162b2 vaccine group will have an immunogenicity blood draw in order to contribute to the analysis. All approximately 4500 participants will contribute to the VE analysis for conditional VE and asymptomatic infection.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 and no therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the potential of Brensocatib (INS1007) as a novel host directed therapy for the treatment of adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The investigators hypothesise that Brensocatib, by blocking damaging neutrophil proteases, will reduce the incidence of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19, thereby resulting in improved clinical outcomes at day 15 and day 29, fewer days dependent on oxygen or mechanical ventilation, and shorter length of hospital stay. High rates of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and overwhelming intensive care unit capacity has been the major issue contributing to excess deaths in Italy and Spain during the pandemic and is likely to be a major issue in other countries such as the United Kingdom in the coming weeks. Treatments that could prevent the requirement for mechanical ventilation or shorten the duration of ICU stay by reducing the severity of ARDS are therefore the number 1 target for COVID19 therapy. The investigators recently conducted a large phase 2 study of Brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis designed to test if treatment with Brensocatib could reduce infective exacerbations and reduce neutrophil elastase activity in the lung in bronchiectasis patients. The study met its primary endpoint of time to first exacerbation and key secondary endpoint of the frequency of exacerbations as well as showing marked reductions in neutrophil elastase concentrations in sputum. Participants will be randomised to receive Brensocatib or placebo 25mg orally once daily for 28 days.","BACKGROUND COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes substantial morbidity and mortality.This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the potential of Brensocatib as a novel host directed therapy for the treatment of adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19. The investigators hypothesise that Brensocatib, by blocking damaging neutrophil proteases, will reduce the incidence of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with COVID-19, thereby resulting in improved clinical outcomes at day 15 and day 29, fewer days dependent on oxygen or mechanical ventilation, and shorter length of hospital stay. Coronavirus (CoVs) are positive-sense single stranded enveloped Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses, many of which are commonly found in humans and cause mild symptoms. Over the past two decades, emerging pathogenic CoVs capable of causing life-threatening disease in humans and animals have been identified, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS- CoV). In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee (Wuhan, China) identified an outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause.5 Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients. This novel coronavirus has been abbreviated as SARS-COV-2 and has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. This novel coronavirus has been designated SARS-CoV-2, and the disease caused by this virus has been designated COVID-19. Initial infections were travel associated with individuals having contact with Wuhan or other affected areas but the disease has now spread to affect hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide with widespread community transmission across the globe. Outbreak forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise. Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 have intensified but to date dexamethasone is the only therapy shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19 while repurposed antiviral drugs did not show clinical benefits in the World Health Organisation SOLIDARITY trial. Mortality from COVID-19 has been estimated at between 0.5% and 3.4% of infected patients and occurs most frequently because of the development of ARDS. In contrast to some, particularly bacterial pneumonias, where patients present with acute respiratory failure and sepsis, the dynamics of COVID-19 infection demonstrate a slow deterioration in oxygenation with the development of bilateral infiltrates in a high proportion of patients, consistent with the development of ARDS. Patients subsequently require mechanical ventilation. Treatments that could prevent the requirement for mechanical ventilation or shorten the duration of intensive care unit stay by reducing the severity of ARDS are therefore the number 1 target for COVID-19 therapy. Neutrophils in ARDS Neutrophil influx into the extravascular compartments of the lungs is a defining characteristic of ARDS. During ARDS, circulating neutrophils become primed, resulting in reduce deformability and retention within the pulmonary capillary bed. They then migrate across the endothelium through the interstitium and epithelium into the airways themselves. As neutrophils migrate they are activated and release oxidants, proteases and neutrophil extracellular traps. All of these processes are important in killing bacterial pathogens but in ARDS these processes become prolonged and excessive leading to progressive lung damage. Neutrophil elastase and other neutrophil proteases such as proteinase-3 and cathepsin-G cause tissue injury resulting in increased epithelial and endothelial permeability which leads to the influx of protein-rich alveolar oedema. Mortality in ARDS correlates directly with the extent of neutrophilia in the lung. Both human clinical data and murine studies demonstrate a key role for neutrophils in ARDS. Neutrophil depletion in multiple models of ARDS including those induced by lipopolysaccharide, acid, ventilator lung injury, transfusion and other stimuli, reduces the severity of acute lung injury including endothelial-epithelial cell damage and capillary-alveolar permeability. Neutrophil proteases and particularly neutrophil elastase are believed to be central to the neutrophil induced lung damage. Neutrophil elastase is a serine protease contained within primary neutrophil granules which is released in response to neutrophil activation or neutrophil extracellular trap formation. It is involved in the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory diseases and therapeutic development of neutrophil elastase inhibitors for use in ARDS has been ongoing for many years. Neutrophil elastase is markedly elevated in human ARDS samples and the inhibition of neutrophil elastase has been demonstrated to reduce epithelial injury in multiple animal models of lung injury across multiple stimuli including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), bleomycin, ventilation, sepsis and many others. Neutrophil elastase is critical to the development of neutrophil extracellular traps, which are highly damaging webs of DNA studded with proteases and other neutrophil derived toxins. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation and the failure to clear NETs have been strongly implicated in the development and poor outcomes from ARDS. Inhibition of neutrophil elastase reduces the formation of NETs. A challenge therapeutically has been how to inhibit neutrophil elastase since administration of competitive inhibitors either orally or through the inhaled route may not be sufficient to block elastase activity in the lung. RATIONALE Neutrophil elastase, proteinase-3 and cathepsin-G are activated during neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow through dipeptidyl peptidase 1 (DPP1; also known as cathepsin C), which removes the N-terminal dipeptide sequence of neutrophil serine proteases allowing active enzymes to be packaged into granules prior to release of neutrophils into the circulation. Brensocatib (INS1007, formerly AZD7986) is an orally delivered selective, competitive, and reversible inhibitor of DPP1. Brensocatib has been shown to inhibit neutrophil serine protease activity in blood in both animal models and healthy volunteers. The investigators recently conducted a large phase 2 study of Brensocatib in patients with bronchiectasis designed to test if treatment with Brensocatib could reduce infective exacerbations and reduce neutrophil elastase activity in the lung in bronchiectasis patients. The study met its primary endpoint of time to first exacerbation and key secondary endpoint of the frequency of exacerbations as well as showing marked reductions in neutrophil elastase concentrations in sputum. Due to the need to replace the circulating pool of neutrophils with new neutrophils which are deficient in elastase, Brensocatib does not have its effect immediately, but rather over several days. Elastase concentrations were reduced at the first time point at day 14 in the phase 2 study, with very large reductions observed at the second time point at day 28. In a cohort of 191 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with a completed outcome, the median time from illness onset to discharge was 22·0 days (IQR 18·0-25·0) and the median time to death was 18·5 days (15·0-22·0). Thirty-two patients (17%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and the median time from onset to mechanical ventilation was 14.5 days. The investigators hypothesise that the mechanism of action of Brensocatib to reduce protease activity will be more rapid in COVID-19 patients compared to bronchiectasis due to a more rapid turnover of neutrophils in acute illness. The objective is to test whether by reducing neutrophil protease activity in neutrophils the investigatorscan prevent or reverse the development of ARDS and thereby improve outcomes in individuals with COVID-19 infection.",Covid19,,Drug: Placebo|Drug: Brensocatib,"Drug:Placebo:Matched placebo|Drug:Brensocatib:Selective, competitive, and reversible inhibitor of DPP1","Placebo Comparator:Placebo:Placebo oral tablet, 25mg once per day for 28 days|Experimental:Brensocatib:Brensocatib oral tablet, 25mg once per day for 28 days",Placebo Comparator[Placebo]:Drug[Placebo]|Experimental[Brensocatib]:Drug[Brensocatib],"Quality of Life measured by EuroQol-5 dimensions-5 levels (EQ-5D-5L)|Neutrophil phagocytosis of FITC-labelled bacteria by flow cytometry|Neutrophil surface protein expression analysis|Neutrophil extracellular trap release|Blood Neutrophil Elastase activity|Neutrophil elastase and heparin binding protein measurement in blood|Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasopharyngeal samples.|Percent of participants with SARS-CoV-2 detectable in nasopharyngeal sample|Adverse events of special interest- hyperkeratosis, infections and dental complications|Changes in Aspartate Aminotransferase U/L over time (hospitalised participants only)|Changes in Alanine Aminotransferase (U/L) over time (hospitalised participants only)|Changes in total bilirubin (umol/L) over time (hospitalised participants only)|Changes in creatinine (umol/L) over time (hospitalised participants only)|Changes in platelets (x10^9/L) over time (hospitalised participants only)|Changes in haemoglobin (g/L) over time (hospitalised participants only)|Changes in white cell count (x10^9/L) over time (hospitalised participants only)|Discontinuation or temporary suspension of treatment|Cumulative incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)|28-day mortality|Duration of hospitalisation (days).|Incidence and duration of new mechanical ventilation use during the trial.|Number of mechanical ventilator free days|Incidence and duration of new oxygen therapy use during the trial|Number of oxygen therapy free days|Change from baseline of National Early Warning Score (NEWS)|Time to discharge or to a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of ≤ 2 and maintained for 24 hours, whichever occurs first.|Mean change in the 7-point ordinal scale|Participant clinical status on 7-point ordinal scale|Time to an improvement of one category from admission using 7-point ordinal scale.|Comparison of participant clinical status between treatment arms",2020-06-05,2021-02-28,2021-02-28,2021-03-26,,2021-03-26,"ClinicalTrials.gov processed this data on March 30, 2021",2021-01-25,No,Yes,No,No,"NHS Lanarkshire, Wishaw, United Kingdom|University Hospitals North Midlands NHS Trust, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom|Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom|Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Portsmouth, United Kingdom|Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool, United Kingdom|University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, United Kingdom|NHS Forth Valley, Larbert, United Kingdom|NHS Highland, Inverness, United Kingdom|Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, Harlow, United Kingdom|Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust, Frimley, United Kingdom|NHS Fife, Dunfermline, United Kingdom|NHS Tayside, Dundee, United Kingdom|Cardiff & Vale University Health Board, Cardiff, United Kingdom|University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, United Kingdom|Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, Bath, United Kingdom|NHS Grampian, Aberdeen, United Kingdom",16,No,No,"Allocation: Randomized|Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment|Primary Purpose: Treatment|Masked: Quadruple (Participant, Caregiver, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)",2.0,,Treatment,Parallel Assignment,,Randomized,Quadruple,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,16 Years,,All,,,No,,"Inclusion Criteria: 6.1.
